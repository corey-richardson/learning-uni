## Introduction to C and C++

### Computer Architecture

Sequential Machine, one thing after another (ignoring multi-threading for time being).

**Microcomputers**

All computers are composed of 3 major sections
- CPU
- Memory (RAM/ROM)
- IO

One byte is 8 binary bits
- 3.3v or 0v, ON or OFF

- Data movement
- Arithmetic and Logical Operations
- Flow Control

### Layers of Abstraction

Physical Hardware
- CPU, Memory, Storage, Interface

BIOS + Operating System Kernel + Drivers

OS Environment (Shell)

Native Application, Native Libraries
- Compiled, C++

Non-Native Application
- Runtime/Interpreted, .NET, JS, Python (Uses or Invokes Native Applications or Libraries) 

### Machine Code and Assembly

Computers ONLY understand machine code.
- ARM
- Intel
- PowerPC
- ATMEL
- etc.

> Hard to write and non-portable.

Assembly language
- Maps directly to machine code
- Highly efficient in speed and size
- Not platform independent
    - Every CPU has its own assembly langauge
- Hard to program and maintain
- Used for *very* low level tasks

<br>

- Write C-Code
- Compile 
- Assemble
- Link
- Execute

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    puts("Hello COMP1000");
    puts("**************");
}
```
```
Hello COMP1000
**************
```

> Set breakpoints for debugging

### Datatypes

`char`
`unsigned char`
`short`
`unsighed short`
`int`
`unsigned int`
`long`
`unsigned long`
`long long`
`unsigned long long`
`float`
`double`
`long double`
`void`

```cpp
int x;
x = 10;
```

```cpp
long y;
y = 300E6; // 300x10^6
```

Creating a variable reserves storage space at a location in memory. The variable type determines the size and layout in memory.

```cpp
char c = 127;
```
```cpp
short x = 4660;
```

Address | Symbol | Value (8 bit)
--- | --- | ---
0   |     |
1   |     |
2   |     |
3   |     |
4   | c   | 127
5   |     |
... |     |
10  | x   | 18
11  |     | 52
... |     |

> (18 * 256) + 52 = 4660

`c` refers to the value `127` <br>
`&c` refers to the memory address `4`

```cpp
int main(void)
{
    unsigned char num = 42;
    printf("The character code for %d is %c\n", num, num);

    return 0;
}
```
```
The character code 42 is displayed as *
```

```cpp
unsigned char ch1 = '*';
unsigned char ch2 = 42;
// ch1 == ch2
```

`sizeof()`

### Building C++ from Terminal

```
C:\Users\richa\Desktop\learning\learning-uni\COMP1000\HelloWorld\HelloWorld>g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld

C:\Users\richa\Desktop\learning\learning-uni\COMP1000\HelloWorld\HelloWorld>HelloWorld.exe
Hello COMP1000
**************
Hello world
```
