## do-while

```cpp
do
{
    // stuff and things
} while (/* condition */)
```

> Runs the code block *at least once* (even when then condition is false), THEN checks the running condition.

## while

```cpp
while (/* condition */) {
    // do this
}
```

> Runs only if the condition is true.

`a++` post increment - use then increment <br>
`++a` pre increment - increment then use

```cpp
while (/* condition */)
    // single line
```

> Allowed but bad practice <br>
> If another line is added and braces aren't added, the second line would be unconditional.

> Unlike Python, indentation and whitespace has no effect. Scope is determined **only** by braces.

> Coding style

## Precedence and Compound Conditionals

```cpp
while ( (condition1) && (condition2) || !(condition3) ) {
    // do stuff and things
    // use brackets to ensure order of operations is clear
}
```

## for

```cpp
int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // do this
}

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i+=10) {
    // do this
}
```

> <u>*Best Practice:*</u> <br>
> C99 - Initialise the loop variable in the initialisation phase of the for loop. <br>
> Only has scope within the loop so no side effects outside of the loop.

> Leaving the loop condition empty will cause an infinite loop.

The keyword `break` can be used to exit the loop early.

Use `continue` to return to the start of the loop before it finishes running.

## goto

> Considered bad practice
