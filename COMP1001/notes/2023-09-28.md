To convert a binary number to octal, we group the binary number into sets of *three*, starting from the right.

`10011011` (Bin) --> (Oct)

010 011 011 <br>
2   3   3  

> = 233<sub>8</sub>

---

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, we group the binary number into sets of *four*, starting from the right.

`010001101011` (Bin) --> (Hex)

0100 0110 1011 <br>
4    6    B

> = 46B<sub>16</sub> 

And vice-versa.

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Signed Integer Representation

Signed Magnitude
- Use the MSB to indicate negativity.
- `+3` would be `00000011`
- `-3` would be `10000011`
- Easy for humans to understand, unintuitive for computers
- Requires a fixed number of bits being used
- Binary Addition Algorithm doesn't work with sign-magnitude
- Allows for two different representations of zero; postive `00000000` and negative `10000000` - this is a waste of memory

One's Complement
- Invert all the bits
- `+3` would be `00000011`
- `-3` would be `11111100`
- Still has two different representations of zero; positive `00000000` and `11111111` - this is a waste of memory

Two's Complement
- One's Complement add 1
- `+3` would be `00000011`
- `-3` would be `11111101`

`0101101` <br>
`1010010` - Invert <br>
`1010011` - Add one

- -12<sub>10</sub>
- +12 --> 00001100
- 11110011
- 11110100<sub>2</sub>

`unsigned`
- 0000 to 1111 (0 to 15)
> use these when negative numbers won't be used

`signed`
- 0111 to 1111 (+7 to -7) as signed magnitude
- 0111 to 1000 (+7 to -8) as two's complement
