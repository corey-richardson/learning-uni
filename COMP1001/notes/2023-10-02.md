## Von Nuemann Architecture

- Memory
- ALU
- Control Unit
- Input / Output System

Program is stored in memory during execution.

Program instructions are executed sequentially.

More memory --> slower memory

The parts are connected to one another by a collection of wires cakked a *bus*.

## Central Processing Unit

Responsible for the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Control Unit
- Registers
- Clock

*Fetch* program instructions <br>
*Decode* each instruction <br>
*Execute* the indicated sequence of operations

- [Isaac CompSci](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/sys_arch_processor?examBoard=all&stage=all&topic=architecture)

CPUs support simple instructions
- Data movement (load / store / copy)
- Arithmetic and Logic (add / subtract / compare)
- Program Control (branch / jump)

### Clock

CPU and bus operations are synchronised to the clock.

`Mhz` or `GHz`

`2GHz` --> clock cycle of `0.5ns`

Every computer contains an internal clock that regulates the rate at which instructions are executed, and synchronises all the various computer components (which may have their own clock).

### Registers

The smallest and fastest memory.

Fast standalone storage locations that hold data temporarily.

- Instruction Register (IR)
- Program Counter (PC) / Instruction Pointer (IP)
- Data Registers

```cpp
int c = a + b;
```
`a` and `b` would be held in data registers during the operation.

### ALU

The ALU must know
- Which operation to perform
- Where is the input data
- Where to store the output data

> All this information is provided by the Control Unit (CU).

1. *Integer* Arithmetic Operations
- Add, subtract
2. Bitwise logical operations 

A common operation is $A=A+B*C$. As such there is a dedicated component for this; Multiplier Accumalator Unit (MAC).

Arithmetic Shift
- when shifting to the right, the leftmost bit (the vacant MSB) is filled with the value of the previous MSB (sign)
- Ideal for signed two's complement binary numbers


Logical Shift
- The vacant bits are filled with zero
- the logical and arithmetic left-shifts are exactly the same
- Ideal for unsigned binary numbers 

Circular Shift
- In this operation, the bits are "rotated" as if the left and right ends of the register were joined. The value that is shifted in on the right during a left-shift is whatever value was shifted out on the left, and vice versa
- frequently used in digital cryptograph

### Control Unit

Instruction Register (IR)
- Contains the current instruction

Program Counter (PC)
- Contains the memory address of the next instruction to be executed

The CU increments the program counter to show the next instruction.

## Main Memory

Consist of a linear array of addressable storage cells that are similar to registers.

Each cell has an address associated with it.

The time takens to fetch / store a word is the same for all words.

If memory contains $N$ words, then $log_2N$ bits are needed to address all words in memory.
- $4$ words, $log_2 4$ bits are needed.

If the memory address space needs $N$ bits, then there are $2^N$ words in memory.
- $2$ bits, $2^2$ words are memory.

1. A computer has 32MB of memory. How many bits are needed to address a single bit in memory?
- 32MB = 32\*1024\*1024 = 33,554,432 bits
- $log_2 \, 33554423 = 25$
:heavy_check_mark:
<br><br>
- 32MB = $32*2^{20}$ bits
- 32MB = $2^5*2^{20}$ bits
- $log_2 \, 2^{25} = 25$

> Convert to POW 2 to simplify

2. If main memory is of 64MB and every word is of 2 bytes how many bits do we need to address any single word in memory?

- $2^6 * 2^{20} = 2^{26}$
- Each word is 2 bytes
- $2^{26} / 2 = 2^{25}$ words
- $log_2{2^{25}} = 25$ bits

## How main memory and the CPU are connected

Control Bus 
- sends appropriate signal whether store or load
- carries commands from the CPU and returns status signals from the devices

Address Bus 
- sends the memory address
- specifies memory location in RAM/ROM/interface device to be accessed; mono-directional
- address space: 16-bits wide --> $2^16$ words = $64*2^{10}$= 64KB
- 32-bit wide --> $2^{32} = 4$ GB; *this is why 32-bit computers cannot use more than 4GB of RAM*

> A 64-bit register can theoretically reference 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 GB (16 exabytes) of memory.

Data Bus 
- sends the data
- bi-directional R/W
- 8, 16, 32, 64-bit; same as word size

## Memory Types

Random Access Memory (RAM) / Main Memory
- Static RAM (SRAM)
    - fast but more expensive
- Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
    - slow but cheap
- Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM)
- Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)
    - transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal

Read Only Memory (ROM)
- Programmable ROM
- Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM)
- Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM)

RAM is volatile <br>
ROM in non-volatile
