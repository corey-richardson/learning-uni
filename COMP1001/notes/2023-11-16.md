## General Purpose Processor

1. *General purpose microprocessors* - general purpose computers, e.g., desktop PCs, laptops
- Very powerful CPUs, e.g., Intel, AMD
- Superscalar and Out of Order, big cache memories

2. *Microcontrollers* - Embedded systems
- Less powerful CPUs, e.g., ARM, Texas Instruments
- They are usually designed for specific tasks in embedded systems
- They usually have control oriented peripherals
- They have on chip CPU, fixed amount of RAM, ROM, I/O ports
- Lower cost, lower performance, lower power consumption, smaller than microprocessors
- Appropriate for applications in which cost, power consumption and chip area are critical

### General Purpose Microprocessors

- They are designed for general purpose computers such as PCs, workstations, Laptops, notepads etc
- Higher frequency than microcontrollers
- Higher cost than microcontrollers
- Higher performance than microcontrollers
- Higher power consumption than microcontrollers
- General purpose processors are designed to execute multiple applications and perform multiple tasks

### Multi-core CPUs

- Multiple cores on the same chip using a shared cache
- Typically from 2-8 cores
- Both cores compete for the same hardware resources
- Both cores are identical
- Every core is a superscalar out of order CPU
- Each core has it's own L1 and L2 cache

### Many-core Processors

- More than 8 CPU cores
- Intended for use in supercomputers, servers and high-end workstations
- Upto ~90 cores
- 512 bit vector instructions
- Lower CPU frequency higher parallelism
- Each core is connected to a ring interconnect via the Core Ring Interface

## Application Specific Processors

General purpose processors offer good performance for all different applications but specific purpose processors offer better for a specific task

Application specific processors emerged as a solution for:
- higher performance
- lower power consumption
- Lower cost

They are classified into:
1. Digital Signal Processor (DSPs)
2. Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs)
3. Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs)

### Digital Signal Processors

- Programmable microprocessor for extensive real-time mathematical computations 
- Specialised microprocessor with its architecture optimised for the operational needs of digital signal processing.
- DSPs tend to have a different arithmetic Unit architecture;
    - specialized hardware units, such bit reversal, Multiply-accumulate units etc
    - Normally DSPs have a small instruction cache but no data cache memory (reduces power consumption, complexity, cost)

### Application Specific Instruction set Processor (ASIP)

- Programmable microprocessor where hardware and instruction set are designed together for one special application
- Usually, they are divided into two parts: static logic which defines a minimum ISA and configurable logic which can be used to design new instructions
- The configurable logic can be programmed and extend the instruction set similar to FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)
- better performance, lower cost, and lower power consumption than GPP

### Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)

- Algorithm is completely implemented in hardware
- An Integrated Circuit (IC) designed for a specific line of a company; fully custom
- It cannot modified; it is produced as a single, specific product for a particular application only
- ASICs are full custom therefore they require very high development costs
- ASIC is just built for one and only one customer
- ASIC is used only in one product line
- Only volume production of ASICs for one product can make sense which means low unit cost for high volume products, otherwise the cost is not efficient
- there are specific languages such as VHDL and Verilog

## Accelerators - Coprocessors

Accelerators / co-processors are used to perform some functions more efficiently than the CPU.

They offer
- `+` Higher performance
- `+` Lower power consumption
- `-` But they are harder to program

## Field Programmble Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

FPGAs are reprogrammable devices that allow us to create our own digital circuits
- An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is an array of logic gates that can be hardware-programmed to fulfill user-specified tasks

FPGAs contain programmable logic components called "logic blocks", and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be "wired together".

An application can be implemented entirely in HW.

The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL) like VHDL and Verilog; hard to program. *High Level Synthesis (HLS)* provides a solution to this problem. Engineers write C/C++ code instead, but it is not that efficient yet.

FPGAs come on a board. This board is connected to a PC and programmed. Then, it can work as a standalone component.

Creating an ASIC also costs potentially millions of dollars and takes weeks or months to create.

However, the recurring cost is lower than the cost of the FPGA (no silicon area is wasted in ASICs).

ASICs are cheaper only when the production number is very high

## GPUs

The GPU's advanced capabilities were originally used primarily for 3D game graphics. But now those capabilities are being harnessed more broadly to accelerate computational workloads in other areas too.

GPUs are very efficient for
- Data parallel applications
- Throughput intensive applications; the algorithm is going to process lots of data elements
<br><br>

- A GPU is always connected to a CPU; GPUs are coprocessors
- GPUs work in lower frequencies than CPUs
- GPUs have many processing elements (thousands of cores)
- GPUs have smaller and faster cache memories
- OpenCL is the dominant open general-purpose GPU computing language, and is an open standard
- The dominant proprietary framework is Nvidia CUDA

GPU coding is based on vectorization

> A CPU is like an F1 car, a GPU is like 3000 bicycles.

## Hyperthreading

Simultaneous Multi Threading
- Split physical cores into virtual cores
- Normally 2 threads are executed in one physical CPU core

## Heterogenous Computing

Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processors or cores
- These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar (co)-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks
- Systems with General Purpose Processors (GPPs), GPUs, DSPs, ASIPs etc.
