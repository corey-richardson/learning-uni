*Running State*
- The process is running using the CPU and memory resources.

*Ready State*
- A process is read to run, but is not waiting.

*Waiting State*
- The process cannot run because it is waiting for some event to occur (or data).

On a single core CPU, only one process can run at a time, but many processes can be ready for execution or may be blocked.

*Scheduling Algorithms*
- First Come First Serve
- Fastest Job First
- Priority Scheduling
- Shortest Reamining Time
- Round Robin

These processes can be either:
- **Pre-emptive**; A process might be pre-empted by a higher priority process.
- **Non Pre-emptive**; Once a process starts, it cannot stop, until it completes its allotted time.

## Process States

User Mode Running
- Normal execution of a process.
- Mode switch to the kernel mode is needed when a system call is performed.

Kernel Mode Running
- Can decide whether to run, pre-empt, terminate, resume or block a process.

## Context Switching

The scheduler is responsible for deciding which process to run and for saving and restoring the state of the process as it gets stopped and resumed.

State:
- *Text segment* : the compiled code
- *Data and bss segments* : all global variables and data structures
- *Heap segment* : dynamically allocated data
- *Stack segment* : local variables in the running function
- Machine registers, e.g., Instruction Register

When a process is pre-empted, the OS does a context switch, causing the system to execute in another process context *(there is a performance overhead)*.

## Getting the Process ID - `getpid()`

Every process on the system has a unique process ID number, aka *pid*.

```c
#include <stdio.h> //needed for printf()
#include <unistd.h> //needed for getpid()

int main() 
{
    printf("my process ID is %d.\n", getpid());
}
```

## Cloning a Process - `fork()`

You can create a process via the `fork` system call which clones a process into two processes running the same code
- Fork returns `0` to the child process and the child's 'pid' to the parent process. 

No data are shared after `fork()`.

```c
#include <stdio.h> /* needed for printf() */
#include <stdlib.h> /* needed to define exit() */
#include <unistd.h> /* needed for fork() and getpid() */

int main( ) 
{
    int pid = fork();
    printf("\nHello there\n");

    /* if you are the child process 
    (a fork returns 0 to the child) */
    if (pid == 0) 
    {
        printf("I am the child process: pid=%d\n", getpid());
    }
    /* something went wrong */
    else if (pid==-1)
    { 
        perror("fork"); // error message
        exit(1);
    }
    /* if you are the parent process
    (a fork returns a pid to the parent) */ 
    else
    {
        printf("I am the parent process: pid=%d, child pid=%d\n", getpid(), pid); 
    }

    exit(0); 
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{

    int a = 1, b = 0;
    int pid = fork(); // get process ID

    a++; // a gets incremented in both processes

    printf("\nJust after fork a=%d - b=%d\n", a, b);

    /* if you are the child process
    a fork returns 0 to the child */
    if (pid == 0) 
    {
        printf("I am the child process: pid=%d\n", getpid());
        /* a gets incremented and b is decremented 
        ONLY IN the child process */
        a++; b--; 
        printf("\nIn child process a=%d\n", a);
    }
    /* something went wrong */
    else if (pid == -1)
    {
        perror("fork");
        exit(1);
    }
    // a fork returns a pid to the parent
    else 
    {
        printf("I am the parent process: pid=%d, child pid=%d\n", getpid(), pid);
        /* both a and b are incremented ONLY in the
        parent process */
        a++; b++;
        printf("\nIn parent process a=%d\n", a);
    }

    printf("\nJust before end a=%d - b=%d\n", a, b);
    exit(0);
} 
```

## Replacing a Process - `execve()`

Replaces the current process with a new one.

```c
//program1.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hi from Program #1\n");
}
```

```c
//program2.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h> //for execve

int main()
{
    char *args[] = { 0 };
    execve("program1", args, NULL);
    printf("Error\n");
}
```

```
gcc program1.c -o program1
gcc program2.c -o program2
./program2
Hi from Program #1
```
