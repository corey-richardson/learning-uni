32-bit Registers
> EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP

16-bit Registers
> AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, SP

These are all general-purpose registers; can be used by the user. No specified purpose unlike the 'Instruction Pointer' register which has a reserved use.

There are also eight 80 bit floating point registers:
- ST(0)-ST(7), arranged as a stack (LIFO)

Eight 64bit MMX vector registers
- Used with MMX instructions (physically they are the same as
above)

Eight/Sixteen 128/256/512 bit vector registers
- 128bit use SSE instructions
- 256bit use AVX instructions
- 512bit use AVX2 instructions

## `mul` unsigned multiply

Multiplication may require more bytes to hold the result.

Multiplier | Multiplicand | Product
--- | --- | ---
M8/R8 | al | ax
M16/R16 | ax | dx:ax
M32/R32 | eax | eax:edx
M64/R64 | rax | rdx:rax

Mx:Rx --> Memory (variable) : Register <br>
Product always in `high:low` format

2-bit ($3^{10}$) $*$ 2-bit ($3^{10}$) = 4-bit ($9^{10}$)

```asm
.data
var1 WORD 3000h
var2 WORD 100h
.code ; 16bit multiplication
mov ax,var1
mul var2 ; DX:AX = 0030h:0000h, CF=1

; CF=1 as DX contains non zero data
; literal 0030h + 0000h --> 00300000h
```

```asm
.data
var1 DWORD 3000h
var2 DWORD 100h
.code ; 32bit multiplication
mov eax,var1
mul var2 ; EDX:EAX = 00000000h:00300000h, CF=0

; CF=0 as EDX is 0
```
> Concatenate flag

## `imul` signed multiply

Preserves the sign of the product by sign-extending it into the upper half of the destination register

It sets OF flag to '1' when the less significant register cannot store the result

```asm
.data
var1 SBYTE 48 ; this is decimal
var2 SBYTE 4 ; this is decimal
.code ; 8bit multiplication
mov al,var1
imul var2 ; AH:AL = 00C0h, OF=1
```

OF=1 as 8bits are not enough to hold the signed number C0<sub>16</sub> (0 1100 0000<sub>2</sub>). A '0' is needed in AH to hold the sign.

## `div` unsigned division

```asm
.code ; 16bit division
mov dx,0h ; clear dividend, high
mov ax,8003h ; dividend, low
mov cx,100h ; divisor
div cx ; AX = 0080h, DX = 3
```

```asm
.code ; 32bit division
mov edx,0 ; clear dividend, high
mov eax,8003h ; dividend, low
mov ecx,100h ; divisor
div ecx ; EAX = 0000 0080h, EDX = 3
```
