```c
#include <stdio.h>

int findMin(int arr[], int arrLen);
int findMax(int arr[], int arrLen);

int main()
{
    int arr[10] = { 5, 7, 4, 1, 5, 8, 9, 4, 2 };
    printf("Min: %d\n", findMin(arr, 9));
    printf("Max: %d\n", findMax(arr, 9));
}

int findMin(int arr[], int arrLen) {
    int min = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arrLen; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < min) {
            min = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return min;
}

int findMax(int arr[], int arrLen) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arrLen; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

Before the C/C++ compiler compiles the code, the preprocessor makes a pass through the program looking for preprocessor directives.

The output of this preprocessor step is then processed by the C/C++ compiler.

All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (`#`).

`#include`: brings in code from another file, typically a header file or library, e.g., `#include <stdio.h>` loads the code from this library. 

`#define`: allows a constant value to be declared for use throughout your code. Macro definitions are not variables and cannot be changed by your program code like variables.

C/C++ provide us with several functions being able to measure the execution time of a block of code, aka timers.

The code below is not enough, we need to run the function many times and take average time, why?
- apart from our process, other processes use the hardware resources (e.g., cache, CPU) too.

```c
start_time = timer();
Function();
end_time = timer();
Print(end_time-start_time);
```

Comparing FP values
```
if (abs(a-b) / b) < value:
    // equal
```
