A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the
computer hardware - it is a program that lets us run other programs.

OS is software that allows a user to run other applications on a computing device

While it is possible to write a software application without using an OS, the
vast majority of applications are written for an OS, which allows them to take
advantage of common libraries and not worry about specific hardware
details.

OS provides routines to read/write from disk, print to screen.

OS manages I/O devices, such as keyboard, mouse, printer, screen, network
devices etc.

*Hardware* 
- provides basic computing resources
- CPU, memory, I/O devices

*Operating system*
- Controls and coordinates use of hardware among
various applications and users

*Application programs*
- Word processors, compilers, web browsers,
database systems, video games

*Users*
- People, machines, other computers

---

OS is a resource allocator
- manages all resources
- decides between conflicting requests for resource usage

OS is a control program
- controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use

Objectives
- Convenience (UI, e.g. GUI)
- Efficiency (manage HW resources)
- Hardware resources abstraction from users

*GUI / CLI*

## Threads, Processes and Programs

Program
- executable file containing a set of instructions

Process
- an executing instance of a program

Thread
- the smallest executable unit of a process
- a process can have multiple threads
- all threads of a process share memory of that process

Multi-user OS <br>
Multi-processing OS <br>
Multi-tasking OS <br>
Multi-threading OS <br>

Real Time OS
- responds to input instantly
- e.g. in a car accident the airbag must open at the right time
- tends to only be for application-specific purposes, not general

---

## Role of the OS

Resource Allocation

Process Management
- Create, load, execute, suspend, resume, terminate processes
- scheduling
- allocate / deallocate resources

Processor Management
- Ensure each application receives enough of the processors time

Memory Management
- Map processes to memory

I/O Device Management
- Allows drivers to physically address devices through ports or memory 
- Device drivers

File Management
- File creation / deletion

Provide a UI
- GUI
- CLI

Process Communication
- Synchronisation and communication between processes

Security
- Prevents unauthorised access to data

Scheduling
- Determines which process is running when and how much time it is given
- Sets priorities between processes

System Calls and Interrupt Handling
- System calls are a mechanism where an application program requests a service from the OS
- `printf`, `malloc`, `free`

---

## User Space and Kernel Space

- The *user space*, which is a set of locations where normal user processes run (i.e everything other than the kernel)

- The *kernel space*, which is the location where the code of the kernel is stored and runs

Processes running under the user space have access only to a limited part of memory, whereas the kernel has access to all of the memory; they can only access the user space.

User space processes can only access a small part of the kernel via an interface exposed by the kernel - *the system calls*.

## Parts of the OS

Kernel

Device Drivers

User Interface

System Utilities
- Windows Diagnostics
- Windows Performance Monitor
- Windows Event Viewer
- Windows Registry Editor
- Windows Task Manager

---

## Kernel

Monolithic Kernel
- single static binary file
- all kernel services exist and execute in the kernel address space
- the kernel can invoke functions directly
- *unix, linux*

Microkernel
- some servers run in kernel space and some in user space
- all servers kept seperate and run in different address spaces
- servers invoke "services" from each other by sending messages via *IPC* (Inter Process Communication)
- if one server fails, other servers can still operate
- *windows NT, macOS*

Hybrid Kernels
- combines the speed of simpler design of a monolithic kernel with the modularity of and execution safety of a microkernel
- *windows 10*

## Memory Management

Keeps track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by what.

Map processes to memory locations.

### Swapping

When memory is full: *swapping*.

A process needs to be in main memory in order to be executed but sometimes there is not enough main memory to hold all the currently active processes. So, process are kept on disk and brought in to run dynamically. 

Swapping is the process of bringing in each process in main memory, running it for a while and then putting it back to thhe disk.

### Virtual and Physical Memory

Physical memory is limited.

A computer must be able to address *more* memory (hard disk)

This is why programs use virutal memory address, not physical ones.

The OS and MMU (Memory Management Unit) are responsible for converting virtual and physical addresses.

Virtual memory is divided into pages, normally 4kbytes each. 

Using virtual addresses allows to have memory protection. Virtual memory allows the system to give every process its own memory space isolated from other processes - processes cannot easily interfere with each other.

While physical memory is limited to the size of the RAM chip, virtual memory is limited by the size of the hard disk. RAM also has direct access to the CPU, while virtual RAM does not.

### Process States

- Running State
- Ready State
- Waiting State

### Context Switch

When the CPU switches to another process then
- system must save the state of the old process
- load the saved state for the new process

Context-switch time is an overhead; system does no useful work while switching.

### Interrupts

Interrupts are signals sent to the CPU by external devices, normally I/O devices

Hardware Interrupts
- e.g. transferring data from the hard disk

Software Interrupts
- System calls

Traps
- Generated by the CPU itself to indicate that some error occurred
- e.g. zero division, invalid memory access

## Virtualisation

Running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.

*VMware*

> A VM lets you run a virtual machine on any hardware. Docker lets you run an application on any operating system. It uses isolated user-space instances known as containers. Docker containers have their own file system, dependency structure, processes, and network capabilities.
