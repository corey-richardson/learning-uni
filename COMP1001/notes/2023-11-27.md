For a program to execute as a process, it has to be loaded into memory via a program loader.

The `.exe` file containing the program consists of several sections/regions of the program.

A process is a program plus it's execution content.

## Stack

*Last In First Out*

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ycMLdgHHrCGR2OqnSX8_sM8gPGpalPRXZUuKP43Zq2EsfG8fyPBqAC54qKI5eAwqn2WrKihIW19aBYnVE5BWTk7ivtSb65hmswtO37fZOtqA0Cj72UQCcD6GTpKEagAYAnjqbD1k)

Stores temporary variables created by each function, including main.

Every time a function is called, it's local data, function arguments and return values are pushed into the stack. Every time a function exits, all of it's local data are freed (popped from the stack).

Limited size; usual default of 1MB.

The stack allows:
- Nested Subroutines
    - CPU uses the program counter to know where to find the next instruction.
    - When a function is called, the return memory address is stored into the stack so as the program knows where to go when the function ends. <br><br>

    ```cpp
    int main() 
    {
        function1();
    }

    void function1()
    {
        function2();
    }

    void function2()
    {
        ...
    }
    ```

- Function Local Variables

Stack Memory is limited. We cannot define large data structures inside functions.

```cpp
int main() 
{
    function1();
}

void function1()
{
    int A[1000000]; // will probably crash, statically allocated
}
```

The solution to this would be to point to an array stored outside of stack memory.

## Heap

Contains all the data allocated dynamically.

`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`

`free`, `delete`

It's contents are accessible by any function.

```cpp
int main() 
{
    function1();
}

void function1()
{
    int* A = new int[1000000]; // will probably crash
    delete A;
}
```

Once we have allocated memory into the heap, we are responsible for deallocating this memory too, otherwise a memory leak occurs.

```
delete --> If  you used the 'new' operator
free --> If you used 'malloc'
```

The size is restricted only by the DDR memory size.

```c
int* array = (int*) malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
```
`malloc` allocates a block of memory in the heap. It's parameter is the amount of memory to be allocated.

> `void *` is a pointer to everything; it's datatype will be given later using a typecast.

```c
int* array = (int*) calloc(4, sizeof(int));
```
`calloc` allocated a block of memory in the heap, AND initialises to zero. The first parameter is the number of elements to allocate and the second is the size of each element.

`malloc`/`calloc` cannot always guarentee memory allocation; *defensive programming is needed*.
```c
int* array = (int*) malloc(4 * sizeof(int));

if (array == NULL) {
    printf("Memory is not allocated.\n");
    return -1;
}
```

`realloc` reallocates a previously given area of memory assigned by `malloc` or `calloc`. The first parameter is the memory address of the current array, and the second parameter is the new size of the array. <br>
It maintains the previous arrays garbage values.

When we no longer need an array, use `free()` to deallocate the memory.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
```

## C++ equivalent of `malloc` and `free`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a = 10; // stored in stack
	int* p = new int(); // allocate memory in heap
	*p = 10;
	delete (p);
	p = new int[4]; // array in heap allocation
	delete[] p;
	p = NULL; // free heap
	return 0;
}
```

## Fragmentation

![](https://prepinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Fragmentation-in-OS.webp)

When processes exit, they create memory holes. The OS tries to fit new processes to the available holes; this causes a new smaller hole - fragmentation.

## Growing Processes

Processes may increase their memory at runtime; e.g. dynamic allocation. 

If the growing process is next to a memory hole, the memory management will use that space. What if there is no unused memory next to the growing process?

If there is a hole with the desired memory space, the process can be moved here; *memory compaction*, introduces an overhead.

If there is no hole with the desired memory space then some processes will be swapped out onto the disk to create space into memory; *swapping*.

If there is no swap space left on the disk and there is no large enough hole, then the process will be terminated.

## Page-based Virtual Memory

Physical and Virtual memory are divided into equal-sized memory blocks.
- The blocks of physical memory are called frames
- The blocks of virtual memory are called pages
- Their size is always a power of 2
- In Linux, the default size is 4kbytes 

A page may be placed to any available frame.

When a process is swapped in, only the pages that are expected to be needed right away are loaded into memory.

- Allows for keeping just the parts of a process that we are using in memory and the rest on the disk.
- Does not limit the size of the process to the size of the physical memory.
- Allows memory allocation to be non-contiguous (frames are not written into consecutive memory locations) and thus no fragmentation occurs, simplifying memory management and obviating any need for compaction.
- Allows to keep more processes in memory than the sum of their memory requirements.
