## Computer Architecture

Silicon Dioxide
- Semiconductor

Switch/Transistor (On/Off) 
- Many switches together == chip

George Bool --> Boolean Logic

> CMOS - Complimentary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor

Current > 70% == 1 <br>
Current < 30% == 0 <br>
Else, undefined.

## Logic Gates

Abstraction of logic into a single symbol

**NOT** Gate
- 0 --> 1
- 1 --> 0
- Z = A'

![NOT Gate](https://gurmeet.net/Images/puzzles/three_not_gates.png)

**AND** Gate
- 00 --> 0
- 01 --> 0
- 10 --> 0
- 11 --> 1
- Z = A . B

![AND Gate](https://www.vedantu.com/question-sets/34cb5291-c2c8-4a5a-9b43-2bcfa76071606917240058642263338.png)

**OR** Gate
- 00 --> 0
- 01 --> 1
- 10 --> 1
- 11 --> 1
- Z = A + B

![OR Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Or-gate-en.svg/1280px-Or-gate-en.svg.png)

**XOR** Gate
- Exclusive OR
- 00 --> 0
- 01 --> 1
- 10 --> 1
- 11 --> 0
- Z = A (+) B

![XOR Gate](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/XOR.png)

**NAND** Gate
- NOT AND
- 00 --> 1
- 01 --> 1
- 10 --> 1
- 11 --> 0
- Z = (A . B)'

> NAND Gate uses fewer transistors then AND and NOT gate

- 01 --> 0
- 10 --> 0
- 11 --> 0
- Z = (A + B)'

## Boolean Axioms and Theorems

Identity Property
- x + 0 = x
- x . 1 = x
- x + 1 = 1
- x . 0 = 0

Idempotent Property
- x + x = x
- x . x = x

Complement Property
- x + x' = 1
- x . x' = 0

Involution Property
- (x')' = x

Commutative Property 
- x + y = y + x
- x . y = y . x

Associative Property
- x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
- x . (y . z) = (x . y) + z

## Half Adder (2-digit)

> Adds two decimal digits
> Outputs two digits (carry and sum)

5 + 6 --> Sum (XOR) = 1, Carry (AND) = 1

Same applies for binary values

1 + 1 --> Sum = 0, Carry = 1 (10)

## Full Adder (3 inputs)

The half-adder is a very simple circuit and not really
very useful because it can only add two bits together.

## Introduction to Digital Electronics Notes

1. Draw `F = (A’ . B’ + A . B) + (C’ . D’ + C . D)`
> F = ((NOT A AND NOT B) OR (A AND B)) OR ((NOT C AND NOT D) OR (C AND D))
