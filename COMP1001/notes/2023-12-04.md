A process is an executing instance of a program.

A thread is the smallest executable unit of a process. A process can have multiple threads. All threads of the same process share the memory of that process.

A process can be broken down into
1. Text segment, heap segment, static data segments
2. Stack , instruction pointer and registers
    - Each thread has its own stack, instruction pointer and registers
    - Each thread has its own thread ID

## Advantages of Threads

Threads are light compared to processes.

- The OS does not have to create a new memory map (recall previous lecture) for a new thread, as it does for a process
- The OS does not have to keep track of open files amongst different threads
- Switching between threads of the same process has less overhead than process switch
- A multithreading application scales better by adding more CPU cores

## OpenMP

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>

// Define parallel behaviour for 'for' loop using OpenMP library
#pragma omp parallel for

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int N = 1000;
	
	int X[1000];
	double Y[1000];

	fill_n(X, 1000, 25); // <algorithm>

	for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
	{
		Y[j] = sqrt(X[j]); // <math.h>
		cout << X[j] << " " << Y[j] << endl;
	}
}
```

## Loop Unroll

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
{
    A[i] = B[i];
}
```
```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i+=4)
{
    A[i] = B[i];
    A[i+1] = B[i+1];
    A[i+2] = B[i+2];
    A[i+3] = B[i+3];
}
```

The number of *load* and *store* operations is reduced. A load/store operation needs 1-3 CPU cycles.

The number of L1 Data accesses is reduced.

## Function Inline

Saves the overhead of pushing and popping to and from the stack.

Mitigates risk of stack overflow vulnerability.
