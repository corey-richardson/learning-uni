## Programmers Responsibilities

A networks core function is to transmit and recieve raw bytes. <br>
It does not inherently understand the content of the data being transferred; it simply handles the transmission.

Define Communication Interface
- Establish protocols for how applications will communicate with each other.
    - REST, SOAP, gRPC, etc.
- Ensure both sender and receiver understand the format and sequence of data.
    - JSON, XML
    - a request for data followed by an acknowledgment
- Provide clear API documentation or an interface description (e.g., Swagger for REST APIs or WSDL for SOAP).

Serialization & Marshaling
- Convert complex data structures to a byte stream (serialization in Java)
- Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures (e.g., objects in programming languages) into a format suitable for transmission, such as a byte stream.
- Marshaling refers to packaging data in a format that can be sent between different systems.
- Unmarshal byte streams back into structured data after transmission.
- Unmarshal/Deserialize: On the receiving end, rebuild the data structure from the transmitted format.

Data Format Translation
- Systems often use different data formats. Translating between these formats ensures compatibility during communication. Handle differences in data formats across systems
- Use internet protocols to encode data as text for compatibility across diverse systems.
- Use widely accepted formats like JSON, XML, or YAML for compatibility.
- If systems use proprietary or non-standard formats, write logic to translate between the formats.
- Encode data into text or binary for efficient transmission. For example, use Base64 for binary data in a text-based protocol like HTTP.

## Web Services

A web service is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that enables software applications to communicate over a network, typically the internet.

Unlike traditional APIs that may operate locally (within the same application or system), web services inherently rely on a network connection.

Web Services are designed for software-to-software communication. They typically provide data or perform tasks for other applications. Websites are designed to deliver content for end-users via web browsers.

> "A software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network.", World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

- Interoperable: The ability to work across different systems, platforms, and programming languages.
- Machine-to-Machine: Focus on automated processes rather than human interactions.

Cross-Platform Support
- Web services are platform-agnostic. The client and server can run on different operating systems or platforms, ensuring flexibility in diverse environments.

Language Independence
- Neither the client or the server needs to be written in a specific programming language. This fosters interoperability and simplifies integration across heterogeneous systems.

Standards-Based Communication
- Typically rely on widely used protocols like HTTP, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), or REST (Representational State Transfer), making them well-suited for diverse applications.

Scalability and Adaptability
- Their ability to operate independently of platform and language makes web services highly adaptable to changing requirements, such as system upgrades or integrations.

### Web Services in Business-to-Business (B2B) and Technical Contexts

Web services play a crucial role in enabling businesses and systems to communicate efficiently over the internet. They are especially valuable in B2B (Business-to-Business) scenarios, where automation and data exchange drive operational success.

- Automated Data Exchange
- Service Integration
- Global Collaboration

### Technical Insights into Web Services

Web services can introduce heavy overhead for both network traffic and processing power.

Most web services rely on HTTP for communication using standard methods like `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.

*Port 80* is the default port for HTTP traffic, which makes web services firewall friendly, since most networks allow HTTP traffic through Port 80.

Web services exchange data in formats like XML or JSON, which are both human-readable and machine-readable. Data formats like XML and JSON can be verbose, increasing the size of the transmitted payload. Parsing and processing these formats require additional CPU cycles, potentially slowing down performance.

- Serialization: Converts structured data into a format suitable for transmission (e.g., converting an object to JSON).
- Deserialization: Converts received data back into its original structure.

### Advantages of Using HTTP for Web Services

- Ubiquity: HTTP is a universally accepted protocol, supported by almost every system connected to the internet.
- Firewall Navigation: Firewalls commonly allow HTTP traffic through port 80 to facilitate regular web browsing. This ensures that web services can operate reliably even in restrictive network environments.
- Leverages Existing Infrastructure: By building on the well-established HTTP infrastructure, web services eliminate the need for specialized communication protocols, reducing complexity and cost.

### Challenges of Web Services

- Performance Overhead: The use of verbose data formats like XML or JSON can result in: Higher network bandwidth usage, Slower processing due to the need for parsing and validation.
- Security Concerns: While HTTP over port 80 is convenient, it is not secure by itself. Sensitive data should be transmitted using *HTTPS* (HTTP over SSL/TLS).

## Types of Web Services

Web services are generally categorised into two types:
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- RESTful (Representational State Transfer)

### Soap Web Services

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for web services that emphasizes strict standards, structured communication, and reliability. It is commonly used in environments where strong formal contracts and robustness are critical, such as enterprise applications and financial systems.

SOAP follows strict communication rules, which ensures predictable and reliable interactions between systems.

SOAP exclusively uses XML for formatting messages.

Every message is a structured XML document that includes:
- Envelope: Defines the message structure.
- Header: Contains optional metadata for processing.
- Body: Includes the actual content or payload of the message.
- Fault: Handles errors and exceptions.

SOAP services are described using Web Services Description Language (*WSDL*), which provides:
- Service Endpoint: URL where the service can be accessed.
- Methods: Operations that can be invoked.
- Parameters: Inputs required by each method.
- Data Types: Formats and structures of data (inputs/outputs).

WSDL provides a machine-readable description of the service, its methods, and data formats.

#### Key Advantages of SOAP

SOAP ensures strict validation of data formats, reducing the risk of data mismatches.

SOAP works across platforms and programming languages due to its reliance on XML and standardized protocols.

SOAP headers allow additional information, such as authentication or transaction details, to be included.

SOAP supports advanced security features through standards like WS-Security, which can handle encryption, signing, and authentication.

Modern IDEs can parse the WSDL, allowing developers to easily import and integrate SOAP web services.

#### Key Disadvantages of SOAP

SOAP is verbose and can be challenging to implement compared to simpler approaches like REST.

XML-based messages and the strictness of SOAP add processing and network overhead. Slower than RESTful services, especially in lightweight use cases.

SOAP services are tightly bound to their WSDL, making them less flexible for changes without affecting clients.

### RESTful Web Services

RESTful web services have emerged as the dominant choice for modern web applications due to their lightweight design, intuitive architecture, and flexibility. Unlike SOAP, which is a rigid protocol, REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that prioritises simplicity and efficiency in communication.

Lightweight Design. REST uses standard HTTP methods. These methods are universally understood and supported across platforms. Minimal overhead makes REST faster and easier to implement than SOAP.

REST follows an architectural style, not a strict protocol, allowing for greater flexibility. Developers have the freedom to design APIs that fit their specific use cases, as long as they adhere to REST principles.

Resources, not actions, are the focus in REST. URLs represent entities rather than functions or server-side scripts. e.g. Resource URL: `/users/123` (fetches user with ID 123). Action-oriented URLs (non-RESTful): `/getUser?id=123`.

Each request is treated independently. The server does not store any client session information. All necessary data for the request must be sent by the client.

Easier to scale since servers don't manage session state. Improved fault tolerance—no dependency on previous requests.

REST supports multiple data formats, making it adaptable for different use cases. JSON, XML, HTML.

#### Key Advantages of RESTful

Simpler to design and deploy compared to SOAP. Uses existing HTTP infrastructure, avoiding the need for additional protocol layers.

Statelessness ensures that each request is processed independently, making load balancing and scaling easier.

Works with multiple formats (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML). Adapts well to various use cases, from lightweight mobile apps to complex web applications.

Intuitive and descriptive URLs improve usability and maintainability.

Lightweight messages reduce processing and network overhead. Stateless interactions simplify the server-side logic.

#### Key Disadvantages of RESTful

Unlike SOAP, REST does not have native security standards like WS-Security. Security must be implemented externally using techniques like OAuth, JWT, or HTTPS.

REST relies on HTTP status codes for error reporting (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`), which can be limited in expressing complex error scenarios.

Statelessness can make it harder to maintain consistency in applications that require transactional operations across multiple requests.

## Adding Volley to a Project

Volley is a library for handling network operations in Android, such as making API requests and managing network responses efficiently.

To use Volley, you need to include its dependency in your project's `build.gradle` file:
- `app/build.gradle`
- Add the Volley dependency under the `dependencies` section:
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
    implementation(libs.appcompat)
    implementation(libs.material)
    implementation(libs.activity)
    implementation(libs.constraintlayout)
    testImplementation(libs.junit)
    androidTestImplementation(libs.ext.junit)
    androidTestImplementation(libs.espresso.core)
    implementation("com.android.volley:volley:1.2.1") // Add this line
    }
    ```
- Sync the project with Gradle files by clicking Sync Now in Android Studio.

Volley requires internet access to perform network operations. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@style/Theme.MyApp">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

- `INTERNET`: Required for making HTTP requests.
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: Used to check the current network state (e.g., Wi-Fi or mobile data).
- `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`: Optional, used for accessing Wi-Fi-specific network details.

## Example API Request

```java
import com.android.volley.Request;
import com.android.volley.RequestQueue;
import com.android.volley.Response;
import com.android.volley.VolleyError;
import com.android.volley.toolbox.StringRequest;
import com.android.volley.toolbox.Volley;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Instantiate the RequestQueue
        RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);
        String url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1";

        // Request a string response from the provided URL
        StringRequest stringRequest = new StringRequest(Request.Method.GET, url,
                new Response.Listener<String>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onResponse(String response) {
                        // Display the response
                        Log.d("VolleyResponse", "Response is: " + response);
                    }
                }, new Response.ErrorListener() {
            @Override
            public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error) {
                // Handle error
                Log.e("VolleyError", "That didn't work!", error);
            }
        });

        // Add the request to the RequestQueue
        queue.add(stringRequest);
    }
}
```

`RequestQueue` manages a collection of network requests (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) and controls how and when each request is executed.

You add requests to the queue, and the `RequestQueue` takes care of dispatching them.

Asynchronous Processing. All requests are processed in the background. This ensures the UI thread remains responsive, preventing your app from freezing while a request is being processed.

Requests in the `RequestQueue` can be assigned different priorities (e.g., high, low). Higher-priority requests are processed before lower-priority ones.

```java
stringRequest.setPriority(Request.Priority.HIGH);
```

If a request fails due to transient network issues (e.g., timeouts, packet loss), `RequestQueue` can automatically retry the request. This retry behavior is configurable, allowing you to set the number of retries and the backoff policy.

```java
stringRequest.setRetryPolicy(new DefaultRetryPolicy(
    5000, // Timeout in milliseconds
    3,    // Maximum number of retries
    DefaultRetryPolicy.DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MULT
));
```

Volley includes a built-in caching mechanism to minimize redundant network calls. When a request is made, Volley first checks the cache for a matching response. If the data is found and still valid, Volley delivers the cached response instead of making a new network call. If not, it fetches fresh data from the server and updates the cache.

To avoid creating multiple instances of RequestQueue, use a singleton:

```java
public class VolleySingleton {
    private static VolleySingleton instance;
    private RequestQueue requestQueue;
    private static Context ctx;

    private VolleySingleton(Context context) {
        ctx = context;
        requestQueue = Volley.newRequestQueue(ctx.getApplicationContext());
    }

    public static synchronized VolleySingleton getInstance(Context context) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new VolleySingleton(context);
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public RequestQueue getRequestQueue() {
        return requestQueue;
    }
}
```

To cancel pending requests, tag them:

```java
stringRequest.setTag("myTag");
requestQueue.cancelAll("myTag");
```

## Gson Library

Gson is a Java library developed by Google for converting Java objects to JSON format and vice versa. It is widely used in both Android and Java applications for handling JSON data in a simple and intuitive way.

- Serialization: Converts Java objects into JSON format.
- Deserialization: Converts JSON data into Java objects

Gson provides simple methods like `toJson()` and `fromJson()` to handle JSON data, making it user-friendly.

Gson offers the ability to customize the serialization and deserialization processes. This is useful if you need to modify how specific fields are handled (e.g., format changes, conditional fields) or exclude certain fields from the JSON output.

Gson is lightweight and fast, making it suitable for mobile and Java applications.

Gson can handle complex data types like lists, maps, and custom objects without requiring additional configuration.

You can choose between different formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and handle them accordingly.

```java
// Create a Java object
User user = new User("John", "Doe");
// Convert to JSON
Gson gson = new Gson();
String json = gson.toJson(user);
// Convert JSON back to Java object
User newUser = gson.fromJson(json, User.class);
```

## MockAPI.io

Developers can create mock APIs that mimic real server behavior. This allows them to simulate API responses and test the application's functionality before integrating with a real backend.

MockAPI.io allows you to define endpoints that return specific JSON data. This helps you simulate how your application would behave with actual data from a live API, without the risk of corrupting real server data.

It helps in building applications and testing functionality without using a live server.

This is especially useful for early development stages and for testing the frontend without relying on the actual backend server.

## Types of JSON Requests

`JsonArrayRequest`
- Used to retrieve a JSON array from the server
- ```json
    [
        { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe" },
        { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith" }
    ]
    ```

- `JsonObjectRequest`
- Used to retrieve a JSON object from the server
- ```json
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "position": "Developer",
        "department": "Engineering",
    }

## Model and API Service Class

### Model Class

The Model class is used to represent an entity or object in your application. 

In this case, it represents an employee with attributes like `id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email`. These fields correspond to the data you will receive or send to the API.

```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String firstname;
    private String lastname;
    private String email;

    // Constructor
    public Employee(int id, String firstname, String lastname, String email) {
        this.id = id;
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getFirstname() {
        return firstname;
    }

    public void setFirstname(String firstname) {
        this.firstname = firstname;
    }

    public String getLastname() {
        return lastname;
    }

    public void setLastname(String lastname) {
        this.lastname = lastname;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

### API Class

This API service class manages the interactions with the backend API, including making requests like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. The class also initialises and manages the request queue with the Volley library.

```java
public class EmployeeService {
    private static final String BASE_URL = "http://10.224.41.11/comp2000";  // Your base API URL
    private static RequestQueue requestQueue;
    private static final Gson gson = new Gson();  // Gson to serialize/deserialize objects

    // Initialize RequestQueue if not already initialized
    private static void initQueue(Context context) {
        if (requestQueue == null) {
            requestQueue = Volley.newRequestQueue(context.getApplicationContext());
        }
    }

    // GET: Fetch all employees
    public static void getAllEmployees(Context context) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/employees";  // API endpoint for fetching all employees
        JsonArrayRequest request = new JsonArrayRequest(Request.Method.GET, url, null,
            response -> {
                // Handle response (parse into Employee objects)
                Employee[] employees = gson.fromJson(response.toString(), Employee[].class);
                // Process employees
            },
            error -> {
                // Handle error
                error.printStackTrace();
            });

        // Add request to the queue for processing
        requestQueue.add(request);
    }

    // GET: Fetch employee by ID
    public static void getEmployeeById(Context context, int id) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/employees/" + id;
        JsonObjectRequest request = new JsonObjectRequest(Request.Method.GET, url, null,
            response -> {
                Employee employee = gson.fromJson(response.toString(), Employee.class);
                // Process employee
            },
            error -> {
                error.printStackTrace();
            });

        requestQueue.add(request);
    }

    // POST: Add a new employee
    public static void addEmployee(Context context, Employee employee) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/employees";
        String json = gson.toJson(employee);  // Convert employee object to JSON

        JsonObjectRequest request = new JsonObjectRequest(Request.Method.POST, url, json,
            response -> {
                // Handle response (employee added successfully)
            },
            error -> {
                error.printStackTrace();
            });

        requestQueue.add(request);
    }

    // PUT: Update an existing employee
    public static void updateEmployee(Context context, int id, Employee employee) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/employees/" + id;
        String json = gson.toJson(employee);

        JsonObjectRequest request = new JsonObjectRequest(Request.Method.PUT, url, json,
            response -> {
                // Handle response (employee updated successfully)
            },
            error -> {
                error.printStackTrace();
            });

        requestQueue.add(request);
    }

    // DELETE: Delete an employee
    public static void deleteEmployee(Context context, int id) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/employees/" + id;

        JsonObjectRequest request = new JsonObjectRequest(Request.Method.DELETE, url, null,
            response -> {
                // Handle response (employee deleted successfully)
            },
            error -> {
                error.printStackTrace();
            });

        requestQueue.add(request);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of this Structure

The `Employee` class represents the data, and the `EmployeeService` class manages API communication, making it easier to maintain and extend.

This structure allows you to easily add new API endpoints or update existing ones.

By using Volley and processing requests asynchronously, the UI thread is never blocked, ensuring a smooth user experience.
