# COMP 2000 - Software Engineering 2

##  Introduction to Software Engineering

### Assessment

The coursework will focus on develop of an android application using Java.

### What is Software Engineering?

- Analysing user requirements
- Designing
- Building
- Testing

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- Standard business practices to building software applications
- Usually split into 7 steps
    1. Planning
    2. Define Requirements
    3. Design and Prototyping
    4. Software Development
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
    7. Operations and Maintenance

### SDLC Models

#### Waterfall 

Arranges all phases sequentially so that each new phase is dependent on the previous phases outcome 

Useful in small projects or in safety critical applications (e.g. at Collins)

#### Agile 

Iterative development; breaks tasks into smaller iterations, or parts not directly requiring long term planning

Minimises project risks and reduces the overall project delivery time

### Design Activities

Begin once some requirements have been established

Design emerges iteratively through repeated design-evaluation-redesign cycles involving the users
