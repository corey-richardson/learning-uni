## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling data and methods that work on the data into a single unit; a class.

It makes sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users: this is done by declaring class variables and attributes as private, and providing public `get` and `set` methods to access or update values of private variables.

```java
public class Employee
{
    // Private Fields
    private String name;
    private int age; // Java doesn't have uint datatype

    // Public getter and setter for name
    public String getName()
    {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String newName)
    {
        name = newName;
    }

    // Public getter and setter for age
    public String getAge()
    {
        return age;
    }
    public void setAge(int newAge)
    {
        if (newAge >= 0)
        {
            age = newAge;
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Age must be positive.");
        }
    }
}


public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Employee e = new Employee();

        e.setName("Max");

        String eName = e.getName();
        System.out.println(eName);
    }
}
```

## Inheritance

Inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.

`subclass` (child) - the class that inherits from another class

`superclass` (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the `extends` keyword

```java
// Superclass
public class Vehicle
{
    String brand = "Toyata";

    public Vehicle(String brand) 
    {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public void startEngine()
    {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}


// Subclass
public class Car extends Vehicle
{
    int numberOfDoors = 4;

    public Car(String brand, int numberOfDoors) 
    {
        super(brand); // Call to Vehicle constructor
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }

    public void displayCarInfo()
    {
        System.out.println()
        {
            System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
            System.out.println("Number of doors: " + numberOfDoors);
        }
    }
}


// Sub-subclass
public class Sedan extends Car
{
    String sedanModel;

    public Sedan(String brand, int numberOfDoors, String sedanModel)
    {
        super(brand, numberOfDoors); // Call to the Car constructor
        this.sedanModel = sedanModel;
    }

    public void displaySedanDetails()
    {
        System.out.println("Sedan Model: " + sedanModel);
        this.displayCarInfo();
    }
}


// Main
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Car myCar = new Car();

        myCar.startEngine(); // From Vehicle
        myCar.displayCarInfo(); // From Car

        Sedan mySedan = new Sedan();

        mySedan.startEngine(); // From Vehicle
        mySedan.displayCarInfo(); // From Car
        mySedan.displaySedanDetails(); // From Sedan
    }
}
```


`brand` attribute in `Vehicle` is set to `default` - if it was set to `private` then the `Car` class would not be able to access it.

- Code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class in new class.
- Code Organization: organize your code into more logical hierarchies.
- Maintainability: to fox bugs, you only have to make changes in one place, making
the code easier to maintain
- Easier Upgrades: You can add new functionality in subclasses without changing the
existing classes

If a class is declared as `final`, it cannot be extended by any other class. Immutable or secure classes.

```java
final class Vehicle
{
    ...
}

class Car extends Vehicle
{
    ...
}
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance

```java
class Animal
{
    public void animalSound()
    {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}


class Pig extends Animal
{
    public void animalSound()
    {
        System.out.println("The pig says oink.");
    }
}


class Cat extends Animal
{
    public void animalSound()
    {
        System.out.println("The cat says meow.");
    }
}
```

Method Overloading allows multiple methods in a class to have the same name but different parameters increasing the readability and flexibility

There are two ways to overload the method in Java:
1. By changing number of arguments
2. By changing the data type

Method Overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.

1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

## Abstraction

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user

Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces

The `abstract` keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
- Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods.

Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body `public void get();`) but, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared `abstract`.

If a class is declared `abstract`, it cannot be instantiated.

To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.


```java
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void animalSound();

    public void sleep() 
    {
        System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
}
```
```java
Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Will generate an error
```

- Simplifies code by providing a clean interface and hiding unnecessary complexity
- Encourages reuse by allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for abstract methods.
- Enforces a contract that subclasses must adhere to, ensuring that important methods are implemented.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are blueprints of a class that contains abstract methods and constants, and are used to achieve *full abstraction* in Java.

Interfaces cannot contain any concrete methods, except `default` and `static` methods.

The class that implements an interface must provide concrete implementations for all of the interface's methods.

Java does not support multiple inheritance but it does support multiple inheritance with interfaces.

By default, all interface methods are `public` and `abstract`.

```java
interface Animal
{
    void makeSound();
}


class Dog implements Animal
{
    @Override
    public void makeSound()
    {
        System.out.println("Woof"); 
    }
}


class Cat implements Animal
{
    @Override
    public void makeSound()
    {
        System.out.println("Meow"); 
    }
}
```

```java
interface Vehicle
{
    void startEngine();
    void stopEngine();
}

interface Electric
{
    void chargeBattery();
    void showBatteryStatus();
}

// ElectricCar class implements BOTH Vehicle and Electric interfaces; not possible with standard inheritance
class ElectricCar implements Vehicle, Electric
{
    private int batteryLevel = 100;

    @Override
    public void startEngine()
    {
        if (batteryLevel > 0)
        {
            System.out.println("Electric car engine started.");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Battery empty! Engine cannot start.");
        }
    }

    ...
}
```

## Lambda Expressions

A way to express *anonymous functions* in a more concise and readable way.

Used when you need to pass small pieces of functionality as parameters.

- `(parameters) -> expression`
- `(parameters) -> {statements}`

```java
// Filtering Data with Lambda Expressions
import java.utils.Arrays;
import java.utils.List;

public class StreamExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        List<Integer> numbers = Array.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        numbers.stream()
            .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
            .forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
    }
}
```

## I/O Operations

The `Scanner` class is used to enable user's input. Can be found in the `java.util` package.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyScannerClass{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int x, y,sum;
        Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);// Create a Scanner object

        System.out.println("Type a number:");
        x = myObj.nextInt(); // Read user input

        System.out.println("Type another number:");
        y = myObj.nextInt();// Read user input

        sum = x + y; // Calculate the sum of x + y
        System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum); // Print the sum
    }
}
```

The `BufferedReader` Class is used to read text from an input stream efficiently, character by character or by lines.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        System.out.println("Enter your name:");
        String name = reader.readline();

        System.out.println("Enter your age:");
        int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
    }
}
```
