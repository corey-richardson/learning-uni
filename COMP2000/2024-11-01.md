## Introduction to Activity

An Activity represents a single screen in an Android app, each with its own user interface. The `Activity` class is essential in managing how screens are displayed and interacted with.

Most Android apps contain multiple screens, each implemented as a separate Activity. Activities help organize the app into distinct, manageable screens, improving modularity and navigation.

The Main Activity is the entry point for an app, defined in the manifest file. It is the first screen the user sees when they open the app, providing a launch point for other activities.

## Activity-Lifecycle Concepts

`onCreate()` is called when the activity is first created. Essential setup occurs here, such as creating the UI, initialising components and setting up the resources. This is typically where `setContentView()` is called to define the layout.

`onStart()` is invoked just before the activity becomes visible to the user, transitioning from the activity being created to being visible. This is where components can be initialised or re-initialised if they were released in `onStop()` or other lifecycle states.

`onResume()` is called when the activity starts interacting with the user. The activity is at the top of the *activity stack* and ready to capture all user input. This is where you typically start animations, open exclusive-access devices like the camera, and handle any necessary UI updates.

`onPause()` is called when the activity is about to lose focus and enter a Paused state. This can occur if, for example, the user navigates away from the activity but doesn't fully close it (like switching apps). It's used for pausing ongoing processes, saving user data, or stopping animations. Activities here should not perform long-running operations as they're expected to return control to the system quickly.

`onStop()` is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user and happens when a new activity starts, and the current one is fully covered. Used to release resources or suspend operations that donâ€™t need to run while the activity isn't visible.

`onRestart()` is invoked when the activity restarts from stopped state, such as when the user returns to the activity from the background and is usually followed by `onStart()`, allowing the activity to regain visibility.

`onDestroy()` is the final callback before Activity is destroyed completely. Used when activity is finishing (user navigated away completely), or the system is temporarily destroying it to reclaim resources. Used to clean up any remaining resources, save final data, or release anything that may lead to memory leaks.

## What is an Intent?

An Intent is a messaging object that can request an action from another app component, such as starting an activity, service, or sending a broadcast.

Intents can be either explicit (targeting a specific component) or implicit (requesting an action that any component can handle if it matches the criteria).

```js
// Starting an Activity
Intent iLaunchActivity = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NewActivity.class);
iLaunchActivity.putExtra("EXTRA_DATA", "some data");
startActivity(iLaunchActivity);
```

A service is a component that runs in the background without a user interface, typically used for long-running operations.

```js
// Starting a Service
Intent iService = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NewService.class);
iService.putExtra("EXTRA_DATA", "some data");
startService(iService);
```

A Broadcast is a message sent system-wide that any app can receive.

Broadcasts are commonly used for system-level events (e.g., low battery, screen on/off) or app events.

`sendBroadcast()` / `sendOrderedBroadcast()`

```js
// Sending a Broadcast
Intent iSendBroadcast = new Intent("com.example.MY_BROADCAST");
iSendBroadcast.putExtra("EXTRA_DATA", "some data");
sendBroadcast(iSendBroadcast);
```

## Result Intents

If you need an activity to return a result to the calling activity, use `startActivityForResult()` with result intents.

## Menus

- Option menus: The options menu is the primary collection of menu items for an activity.
- Contextual Menus: A context menu is a floating menu that appears when the user performs a long-click on an element
- Popup Menu: displays a list of items in a small, floating menu anchored to a specific view, typically anchored to a button or view and displays below the view when clicked.

By default, every Activity supports an options menu of actions or options. You can add items to this menu and handle clicks on your additions.

The easiest way of adding menu items is inflating an XML file into the Menu via `MenuInflater`.

To define the menu, create an XML file inside your project's `res/menu/ directory` and build the menu.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:title="save"
        android:id="@+id/savech"/>
    <item android:title="Edit"
        android:id="@+id/editch"/>
    <item android:title="Delete"
        android:id="@+id/deletech"/>
</menu>
```
```js
@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) 
{
    MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater();
    inflater.inflate(R.menu.my_menu, menu);
    return true;
}

@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(@NonNull MenuItem item) {
    // Handle item selection
    switch (item.getItemId()) 
    {
        case R.id.savech:
            saveItem();
            return true;
        case R.id.editch:
            editItem();
            return true;
        case R.id.deletech:
            deletItem();
            return true;
        default:
            return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
}
```

## Messages

A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup. It only fills the amount of space required for the message and the current activity remains visible and interactive.

```js
Context context = getApplicationContext();
CharSequence text = "This login Button"

Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, text, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
toast.show();
```

You can use a Snackbar to display a brief message to the user.

Snackbars include user-actionable options, which can provide a better app experience.

```js
Snackbar.make(findViewById(R.id.main_layout), "Email sent successfully", Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
```
