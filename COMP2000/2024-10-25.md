## Usability Testing 

A main aim is to develop interactive products that are usable, and serves the user's needs efficiently and effectively.

Design should be user-centered, considering who will use the product and how it will be used to ensure the product's usability.

Easy to learn
- Users should be able to understand how to use the product without extensive instruction.

Effective to use
- The product should enable users to complete tasks efficiently

Enjoyable
- The experience should be satisfying and positive, enhancing theoverall user experience (UX)

Usability testing traditionally happens in controlled environments, like a lab. This allows the evaluator to focus specifically on ease of use without distractions from the real world.  Testing in a lab or a controlled setting allows evaluators to manage all variables that could affect how users interact with the product. By controlling the environment (e.g., lighting, noise levels) and social factors (e.g., whether the user feels pressured or distracted), testers can focus purely on the usability of the product.

## What is interaction design?

> By interaction design, we mean designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives.

Creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact.

A critical part of interaction design is understanding why a product is being created and who it's for. This means being clear about the primary objective of the interactive product, ensuring it aligns with user needs, expectations, and contexts.

The design objectives can be classified into two main categories: usability goals and user experience goals. Traditionally, usability goals focus on making the product efficient and effective. User experience goals are about the quality of the interaction, focusing on emotional and subjective aspects.

- Effective to use, achieve desired goals
- Efficient to use, perform tasks with minimal effort
- Safe to use, prevents user errors and offers easy recovery
- Good utility, provides all neccessary features and tools
- Easy to learn, understand how to use the product quickly
- Easy to remember, recall usage after a period of non-use

## User Experience

UX addresses how a product behaves and how it is used by people in the real world. 

A well-designed UX ensures that the product is not only functional but also pleasurable and efficient to use, enhancing the user's overall satisfaction.

- Visibility, the more visibile a function is the easier it is for user's to understand what actions they can take
- Feedback, provide users with information about actions they have taken and the results of those actions
- Constraints, limit the kind of interactions that can occur, guiding users towards the correct actions, e.g. deactivating actions that aren't applicable at that moment
- Mapping, logical relationships between controls and their results
- Consistency, designing similar tasks with similar controls
- Affordance, the property of an object that suggests how it should be used, e.g. a Home Screen button shaped like a home provides clear affordance

## Usability Principles and Heuristics

Usability principles are guidelines that help product to "speak the user's language", which means using language and terminology familiar to the user, and avoid technical jargon.

Design Principles are used for informing the initial design, whereas Usability Principles are primarily used for evaluating existing designs.

## Persona, User Story, Scenario and Storyboard

User research is the first step in designing around your users.

User Persona is a fictional character that represents a segment of the target audience for a website or app. In user-centered design, personas help designers focus on the user's needs, ensuring that decisions are made with the target audience in mind. Personas make it easier to visualize and communicate who the primary users are.

A user story is a short statement or abstract that identifies the user and their need/goal. It determines who the user is, what they need and why they need it. There is usually one user story per user persona.


Scenario is a narrative that describes how users perform specific tasks on a site or app. User Scenarios outline the reasons why a user interacts with the system, detailing their goals, questions, or motivations. It is essentially a development of the user story, and can relate to multiple target users.

A storyboard is a visual representation of how the user would react with your site or app.

## User Testing

As products evolve from initial ideas to more detailed conceptual designs and prototypes, the process should involve iterative cycles. This means repeating stages of the design, making adjustments, and testing to improve upon each iteration.

- Formative Evaluation: Done during the design phase to continuously adapt the product to meet user requirements.
- Summative Evaluation: Conducted after the product is complete to judge its overall success and adherence to standards.

A "quick and dirty" evaluation is a common practice in which designers informally get feedback from users or consultants to confirm that their ideas are in line with users' needs and are liked.

Field studies involves observing users interacting with system in their natural environment, providing context-specific insights.

In predictive evaluations experts use their understanding of typical users and design guidelines to forecast potential usability problems, often guided by heuristics and involves theoretically based models.

User testing refers to a technique used in the design process to evaluate a product, feature or prototype with real users.
