Graphical notation used to construct and visualise object oriented systems. Describes the structure of a system by showing:
- classes
- attributes
- operations (methods)
- relationships between objects

### Class Notation

![](https://training-course-material.com/images/0/00/ClassDiagramExample.png)

Class Name
- First Partition

Class Attributes
- Second Partition
- Type follows the colon

Class Operations / Methods
- Third Partition
- 'Services' the class provides
- Return type follows the colon

Class Visibility
- `+` Public attribute
- `-` Private attribute
- `#` Protected attribute

Parameter Directionality
- Each parameter is denoted with `in`, `out` or `inout` which specifies its direction with respect to the caller.
- `in` 
- `inout` 
- `out` 

Class Relationships
- A class may be involved in one or more relationship between classes
- Association
- Inheritance
    - An *abstract* class is shown in *italics*
    - > An abstract class is a class that is designed to be specifically used as a base class. An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function.
- Realisation
    - Relationship between the blueprint class and the object containing its respective implementation level details.
    - This object is said to 'realise' the blueprint class.
- Dependency
    - A special case of realisation
    - Exists between two classes if changes to one class may cause changes to the other.
    - One-way
- Aggregation
    - Represents a 'part of' relationship
    - 'Class 2 is part of class 1'
    - Subset
- Composition

Cardinality
-  One to one
- One to many
- Many to many

## Perspective of Class Diagrams

The choice of perspective depends on how far along in the development process you are.

Conceptual
- Represents the concepts in the domain
- Specification: focus is on the interfaces of Abstract Data Type (ADTs) in the software
- Implementation

## Categories of Requirements

- Functional / Non-functional
- Safety and Security
- Quality, domain, interoperability, CRUD
- High level overview / Detailed

## Requirements Management

Business managers and users will ask for every possible requirement they can think of; they do not consider the cost, time and effort. Unless managed correctly this can sink the project.

Employ prioritisation, staged delivery, cost estimation and change control.
