**Problem Solving**

EFA STTE Update WinXP -> W10
- The Windows 10 version of the EFA would throw errors during MMD and OFP loads.
- We investigated where these errors were being throw in the source code and the conditions that would be required to induce them.
- Using this knowledge, we would make incremental changes to the source code over the course of 2-3 months. This included timestamped debug messages in the log file. It was found the test software would take longer than expected in the RAPDM function.
- We passed this knowledge onto the TE team allowing them to make the required fix and finalise the project.
