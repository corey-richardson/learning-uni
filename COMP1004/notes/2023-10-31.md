## Layouts

- Your SPA could be viewed on all manner of devices.
    - Different screen resolutions.
    - Needs to cope with varying screen widths.
    - Height isn't as much of an issue as you can scroll.
    - Mobile tends to be 320px or less
    - User may not be using fullscreen
- Space will be taken up by toolbars, sidebars, browser features, etc.

Fixed
- Size of page and page elements is fixed, usually using pixels `px` and a unit of measure.
