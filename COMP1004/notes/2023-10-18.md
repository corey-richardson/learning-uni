## Stages of SDLC

SDLC is a model that defines the main steps in software development and their sequence.

Planning
- Requirements: defining the application, what the application will do; e.g. login system, dashboard page etc

Requirement Analysis
- Defining the requirements; e.g. the login page will have username / password fields, buttons, load data from `.db` etc

Design
- Take all the requirements and design the application. What language to use? What frameworks? UML diagrams?
> <sub> Unified Modeling Language, is a way to visually represent the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems. </sub>

Implementation
- Coding

Testing
- Unit testing, integration <sub>(hell)</sub> testing, user testing etc

Deployment
- The system is deployed and installed on customer's premises

Maintenance
- Address any technical issues

## Categories of SDLC

- Waterfall Model
- Iterative Model
- Spiral Model
- Agile Model
    - *This is the model we will use for coursework*
    - Scrum is a popular implementation of Agile

## Waterfall Model

Development process flows in only one direction. The next phase cannot begin until the previous is started.

In the waterfall modelm we hope there will be no requirement changes, mistakes or unexpected factors.

- Requirements are not frequently changing
- Project is simple and short
- Requirements are clear and well defined
- Environment is stable

> "While the Waterfall model is not as popular as more iterative and flexible methodologies like Agile, it can still be useful in aerospace applications for several reasons:

> Regulatory Requirements: Aerospace projects often have strict regulatory requirements and standards that must be followed. The Waterfall model's documentation-heavy nature allows for a clear and auditable trail, which can be crucial in demonstrating compliance with these regulations.

> Risk Management: In aerospace, the consequences of software failures can be severe, potentially leading to loss of life or significant financial losses. The Waterfall model's structured approach helps in identifying and mitigating risks early in the project, which is essential in such critical applications.

> Well-Defined Requirements: Aerospace projects typically involve well-defined and stable requirements. In cases where the requirements are unlikely to change significantly, a Waterfall approach can be efficient as it focuses on getting the requirements right before proceeding to development.

> Long Development Cycles: Aerospace software projects can be lengthy, complex, and costly. The Waterfall model can provide a clear and well-structured plan for these long development cycles, which can help in managing resources, budgets, and timelines.

> System Integration and Testing: Aerospace systems often require extensive integration and testing, including hardware-software integration and verification. The Waterfall model's emphasis on thorough testing and validation before moving to the next phase aligns well with these requirements.

> Traceability: The Waterfall model's documentation and traceability aspects are crucial in aerospace to ensure that every aspect of the software is accounted for, and any changes can be traced back to their source. This is important for maintaining the safety and reliability of aerospace systems.

> Legacy Systems: Many aerospace projects involve integrating new software with existing legacy systems. The Waterfall model's step-by-step approach can be beneficial when dealing with such complex integration scenarios.

> Customer Confidence: In critical aerospace applications, customers and stakeholders often seek a high degree of confidence in the final product's reliability and safety. The structured approach of the Waterfall model can instill a sense of confidence by demonstrating a well-planned and executed development process."

- `+` Simple and easy to use
- `-` No working software is produced until late in the lifecycle.
- `-` Inflexible model that does not allow for revision; difficult to accomadate changing requirements.

## Iterative Model

Develpment begins by implementing *part* of the software. New software is developed during each iteration.

The iterative SDLC model does not require a complete list of requirements before the project starts.

New product versions are made in each cycle.

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/adaptive_software_development/images/iterations.jpg)

- `+` Customers get a working product early
- `+` Customer can provide feedback at each product version
- `+` Requirement changes can be easily accomadated
- `+` Parallel development
- `+` Delta testing is smaller and easier
- `-` More resources required
- `-` Constant management required
- `-` Not ideal for small projects
- `-` Not very suitable to *changing* requirements (compared to Agile)

## Agile

Agile is a philosophy; not a specific development approach.

Scrum, Kanban, XP (Extreme Programming)

Work is split into iterations - sprints.

Fully functional piece of work is delivered every sprint (usually ~2 weeks).

Amount of work per sprint is not strict and can be changed in the middle of the process.

### Scrum

Aims to produce deployable software in each sprint.

Comprises of a:
- Development team
- Product owner
- Scrum master

Sprint planning meetings
- which items will be worked on
- Identify sprint tasks

Daily scrum meetings
- Summarise previous days work and coming days work; opportuninty to identify risks.
- Intended to foster collaboration

Sprint review meetings
- Demonstration of completed software
- Product owner determines which items of work are completed

### Scrum Roles

Product Owner
- Works with stakeholders to create a vision of the product they wish to create and communicate that vision to the scrum team.
- Creates and maintains the product backlog.
> Can be a team member

Development Team
- Self-contained and self-organised team; no overall leader.

Scrum Master
- Removes any impediments to progress
- Faciltates the meetings
- No management authority over the team

### Scrum Items

Product Backlog
- List of the functionality still to be added
- A prioritised features list, often written as *user stories*.

Sprint Backlog
- A list of tasks to be completed during the sprint

User Stories
- Description of the desired functionality of product backlog items
- "As a \<type of user\> I want \<some goal\> so that \<some reason\>."
- "As a user, I want an option to remain logged in so that I don't have to reenter my credentials each time."

### Scrum Activities

Each sprint begins with a sprint planning meeting. The product owner presents the top items in the product backlog to the team and the team memebers figure out how much work they can commit during the coming sprint.

Short daily scrum meetings; stand-ups.

A sprint ends with a sprint review meeting to demonstrate the new functionality to the product owner. The product owner provides feedback to influence the next sprint.

### Agile Pros and Cons

- `+` Fast release of the first product version
- `+` Flexible
- `+` Low project risk
- `-` Difficult to measure the final cost due to frequently changing requirements
- `-` New requirements may conflict with existing architecture
- `-` Frequent changes may cause the project to overrun expected release time
- `-` Very meeting heavy

## Spiral Model

Combination of waterfall and iterative model.

Appropriate for projects that are vulnerable to a variety of hazards that are difficult to predict; focuses on managing risks.

Used for more complex and more expensive projects.

Each phases begins with a design goal and ends with the client reviewing the progress.

Each *prototype* is a working piece of software.
