## Numbers, Proofs and Algorithms

Prime and Composite numbers

Prime numbers are used centrally in encryption algorithms.

*Is there a largest prime number?* <br>
Nope.

*Sieve of Eratosthenes*

Integer division discards remainder.

## Series, Sums and Limits

### Recursion

Defines or solves a problem by making reference to itself (often as a smaller sub problem).

$$2! = 1 * 2$$
$$3! = 2! * 3$$
$$n! = 1*2*3 * ... * n(n-1) * n(n-1)!$$

- [Staircase Problem](https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/climbing-stairs-problem)

$$N(n) = N(n-1) + N(n-2)$$

### Fibonacci Sequence

Recurrence Equation
- New values of a sequence are computed based on previous ones

The Fibonacci series is a classic mathematical series in which the next number is calculated as the sum of the previous two numbers:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.
```

```py
# That means we need two recursive calls in our recursive step.
# Expressed in code:
# fibonacci(3) == fibonacci(1) + fibonacci(2) 

# Define our fibonacci() function that takes n as an argument.
def fibonacci(n):
  # Add print statements within fibonacci() to explore the different recursive 
  # calls.
  print(n)

  # base case
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n

  # recursive step
  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) 

fibonacci(5)
# set the appropriate runtime:
# 1, logN, N, N^2, 2^N, N!
fibonacci_runtime = "2^N"
```

### Sums

$$sum(0, n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

#### Sigma Notation of Sums:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$$
$$\sum_{\text{Lower Limit}}^{\text{Upper Limit}} \text{Formula for the terms}$$

$$\sum_{k=1}^{5} 9^{k-1} = \frac{(1-9)^n}{1 - 9} \text{(Geometric Sum)}$$


### Limits

How a series behaves

`1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...` diverges to infinity <br>
`1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ...` 'approaches' 1 <br>
`1, ½, 1/3, ¼  ...` approaches 0 <br>
`-1 1 -1 1 -1 ...`  does not converge <br> 

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} S(n)$$

### Metrics and Distances

Many computational problems require the computation of distances between elements.

- [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)

A *metric* is a function that defines a distance between two points of a set A. A set with a metric is called a *metric space*.
