# Complexity

## Run-time Complexity of Code

Data-intensive tasks need efficient algorithms.

*Travelling Salesman Problem:*
- Given $N$ cities with given distances, find the shortest distance to visit all of them exactly once.
- Exhaustive Search / Brute Force
- For the first city there are $N$ possibilities.
- For the next city there are $N-1$ possibilities.
- Etc.
- $N! = N*(N-1)*...*1$

- Heuristics (hints) can be used to find sub-optimal/approximate solutions faster.

[P versus NP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)
> asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. <br>
> If the solution to a problem is easy to check for correctness, must the problem be easy to solve?
