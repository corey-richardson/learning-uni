# Syntax and Semantics

Backus Naur Form
- A notation technique used in computer science to precisely describe the syntax of languages.
- It provides a set of rules for defining any language structure and is often used to describe elements of programming languages.
- Only considers form, not meaning. Syntax, not semantics.
