## Vectors

### Coordinates and Vectors

Cartesian co-ordinates (X,Y)

A vector comprises of both magnitude and direction.

A vector can be thought of as a movement. In 2d we can represent a vector by its horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) displacements: $[a, b]$.

$[a, b]$ represents a displacement, not a point on the plane.

> A scalar has magnitude but no direction.

### Vector Magnitude

$$|v| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

$|v|$ is a unit vector if $|v| = 1$. Unit vectors can be used to represent direction.

For any non-zero vector $|v|$, if $k = \frac{1}{|v|}$ then $kv$ is the unit vector pointing in the same direction as $|v|$.

If $v = [3, 4]$, $|v| = 5$. If $k = 1/5$, then $kv = [3/5, 4/5]$ is parallel to $v$ and has magnitude $1$. 

> Triangle Inequality: the shortest path between two points is the straight line joining them; hypotenuse. <br>
> $|v + w| \leq |v| + |w|$

### Scalar Product

Scalar product of two vectors $[a,b]$ and $[c,d]$ is given by:

$$[a,b] * [b,d] = ac + bd$$
