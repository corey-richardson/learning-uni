# Linked Lists

- Addresses, pointers and references
- Linked List ADT
- Linked Lists basic operations
- Implement Stacks and Queues using Linked Lists

---

Standards arrays are of fixed size. If they require more space than what was originally allocated, they have to be reallocated which takes time.

Link Lists can dynamically grow and shrink.

Each node contains the stored value and a pointer to the next node, anywhere in memory; does not have to be contiguous.

A `NULL` pointer refers to the tail of the list.

```cs
class Node
{
    public int value;
    public Node nextNode;
}

class LinkedList
{
    public Node headNode;
    /* In situations where the tail node is commonly used, 
    it may be worth storing this pointer. */
    public Node tailNode;
}
```
