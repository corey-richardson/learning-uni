# Stack and Queue

Abstract Data Types (ADTs) implement generic functionality on collections of other data types.

Stack
- LIFO
- Often used for short-term storage of objects.
- In 3D rendering transformations, matrices go on a stack.
- Running programs have a *run time stack* for parameters and local variables of function calls.

Queue
- FIFO
- Queues hold objects that need to be processed in the order they arrive.

## Data Abstraction

ADTs are structures that can hold collections of data of some type. Their functionality is independent of concrete data type.

- Sets
- Stacks and Queues
- Lists
- Trees
- Graphs

```cs
class Stack {
    int top;
    int data[100];
};

Stack s;
int i;

void push(Stack s, int i) { ... }
int pop(Stack s) { ... }
int top(Stack s) { ... }
int size(Stack s) { ... }
int isEmpty(Stack s) { ... }
```
