## OSI Model – Data Flow

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

Defines how networking systems communicate and send data from a sender to a recipient. The model is used to describe each component in data communication so that rules and standards can be established regarding applications and network infrastructure.

The OSI model contains seven layers that conceptually stack from the bottom to the top. The OSI layers include: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

## TCP / IP

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

General network protocols are typically concerned with routing messages between a sender and a receiver, as well as dealing with lost/corrupted data. TCP/IP are designed for friendly and co-operating users linked in unreliable networks; they are not designed with security in mind.

### IPSEC

- IP Authentication Header
- IP Encapsulating Security Payload
- Does not include mechanisms to prevent traffic analysis

> Internet Protocol (IP) is the common standard that determines how data travels over the internet. IPSec adds encryption and authentication to make the protocol more secure.

### SSL / TLS

Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security

Provides strong crpytographic entity authentication, data integrity and confidentiality.

> It is a protocol or communication rule that allows computer systems to talk to each other on the internet safely. SSL/TLS certificates allow web browsers to identify and establish encrypted network connections to web sites using the SSL/TLS protocol.

> SSL/TLS uses both asymmetric and symmetric encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data-in-transit. Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure session between a client and a server, and symmetric encryption is used to exchange data within the secured session. 

> A website must have an SSL/TLS certificate for their web server/domain name to use SSL/TLS encryption. Once installed, the certificate enables the client and server to securely negotiate the level of encryption.

## Why are networks vulnerable?

Anonymity
- Attacks can come from anyone, anywhere in the world; difficult to establish origin, especially when intermediate hosts are used to disguise an attack.

Many points of attack
- Information is stored on a variety of systems; local machines and network servers.

Sharing
- Many users use systems, with many sets of user credentials open to misuse.

Complexity of a system
- Organisational systems comprise of a variety of networks and of systems with differing OS's (and therefore a different multitude of vulnerabilities).

Unknown perimeter
- Challenging to define a boundary in large and mobile organisations.

Unknown path
- Packet paths may pass into untrusted systems.

## Attack Surfaces

Network Attack Surfaces
- Network protocol vulnerabilities such as open, outward facing ports on web and other servers.

Software Attack Surfaces
- Web server vulnerabilities

Human Attack Surface
- Social Engineering

## Threats

- Eavesdropping and Wiretapping
- Protocol flaws and vulnerabilities
- Impersonation
- Message confidentiality threats
    - Misdelivery, exposure, traffic flow analysis
- Message integrity threats
    - Falisification of messages, noise
- Format failures
    - Malformed packets, protocol failures, implementation flaws
- Website Vulnerabilities
    - Defacement, buffer overflows, dot-dot-slash, application code errors, server-side include
- Denial of Service
    - Transmission failure, connection flooding, traffic redirection

## Firewalls 

A device that filters all traffic between networks; typically an inside and an outside network.

- Packet Filtering Gateways
- Stateful Inspection Proxies
- Application Proxies
- Guards
- Personal Firewalls

Traditionally, networks relied on the security of individual hosts; as the number of hosts increased, the number of points of failure increases, the higher the chance of administritive mistakes and lapses, and the less manageable the network becomes.

Firewalls help to increase the overall security of the subnetwork.

- Protection from vulnerable services
- Controlled access to site systems
- Concentrated security
- Enhanced privacy
- Logging and network statistics
- Security policy enforcement

### Packet Filtering Firewall

Operates at the IP packet level. Filters packets as they are passed between router interfaces.

Packet features may provide basis for filtering:

Source IP Address
- Can control which machines on the internal network may access the internet
- Can control which machines from outside may access the internal network

Destination IP Address
- Can filter which machines can be contacted for which services (e.g. WWW, email server)
- Control which sites outgoing packets from internal users can access

Source and Destination Port Numbers
- Many standard internet services are offerered via "well known" destination ports (e.g. HTTP::80, SMTP::25, FTP::21, etc).
- Can control the accessibility of specific services.

The packet filtering firewall functionality is part of the standard router configuration software; no special hardware or software required. Installation requires no action on the side of the users.
- Fast, flexible

Filtering rules are complex to specify, especially for selective blocking of services is required. There is usually no testing facility to enable correctness of rules; test in production. 

Routers may not provide logging capability, so dangerous packets may not be detected until a break-in has already occurred.

May not be able to filter based on TCP/UDP source ports, leading to holes in the protection. Difficult to filter Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services as the ports are randomly assigned.

### Stateful Inspection Firewall

Packet level firewalls have no concept of "state" or "context"; every packet needs to be examined against the rule set which is very CPU intensive.

Stateful Inspection Firewalls maintain state information:
- If the first packet of a connection passed the rule set, then all packets associated with that connection are also assumed to be ok.

Updating the ruleset will flush the *state table*, leading to increased processing until the table is re-established.

### Application Proxy

Provides a proxy between external systems and hosts offering services on an internal networks. Users can use the proxy as a gateway to the internal network without having a direct connection to the internal machines. This allows a more in-depth control of connections.

Can be used in conjunction with a packet filtering router that directs all permitted connections to the application gateway module.

This means names of internal systems can be hidden from outsiders; the DNS only needs to know of the application gateway.

## Demilitarised Zone

A subnetwork containing an organisation's exposed, outward-facing services. It acts as the exposed point to an untrusted network, commonly the internet.

## Intrusion Detection Systems

User actions conform to a statistically predictable pattern, and do not include commands aimed at subverting security policy. Actions of processes conform to a set of specifications as to what the the process is allowed to do.

Goals of an IDS:
- Detect a wide variety of intrusions
- Detect intrusions in a timely manner
- Present analysis in a simple and easy to understand format
- Be accurate - false positives reduce the confidence in the system [TERPROM!]

### IDS Models

Anomaly Detection
- Reports when user actions or processes deviate from the expected

Misuse Detections
- Sequence of known security policy violations are being executed

.        | True | False
---      | ---  | ---
Positive | Successfully detected an attack | An event that the IDS believes to be an attack but is not
Negative | Does not report legitimate traffic as an intrusion | An attack is not detected by the IDS


### Misuse Detection

Signatures: events or sets of events that match a predefined pattern of events for a known attack

- Very effective at detecting attacks without generating an *overwhelming* number of false positives.
- Can only detect known attack methods
- Rules are tightly defined; small changes to the attack method are not detected

Misuse Detection based methods often use "Expert Systems" to analyse the data and apply rulesets. Recent versions use more adaptive methods such as neural networks to improve detection capabilities.

**Snort**: open source free NIDS

- Traditionally signature based NIDS
- However,
- > "Snort is an open source network intrusion prevention and
detection system utilizing a rule-driven language, which combines the benefits of *signature*, *protocol* and *anomaly* based inspection methods. With millions of downloads to date, Snort is the most widely deployed intrusion detection and prevention technology worldwide and has become the de facto standard for the industry"

### Insertion and Evasion Misuse Detections

Insertion
- Send a packet with an additional character and invalid TCP checksum

Evasion
- Add data to the payload of the TCP three-way handshake

### Anomaly Detection

Makes the assumption that attack behaviour will differ from "normal" behaviour.

Threshold Metric
- A minimum of $m$ and a maximum of $n$ events are expected to occur.

Statistical Moments
- Mean and Standard Deviation

Markov Model
- Time/State based. The probability of an event happening given a previous event
- $P(Event_2 \, | \, Event_1)$

Neural Network
- An offshoot of artificial intelligence; neural networks have proven highly successful in a number of machine learning applications.

Genetic Algorithms
- A search technique used to find approximate solutions to optimisation and search problems.

Data Mining
- Searching large volumes of data for patterns.

Computer Immunology
- Algorithms designed to exploit the immune systems characteristics of learning and memory

*Advantages:*
- Detect unusual behaviour and therefore detect symptoms of attacks without prior knowledge.
- Can produce information to be fed into misuse detectors to define attack signatures.

*Disadvantages:*
- Can produce a large number of false positives due to unpredictable behaviour.
- Large "training sets" are required to characterise "normal" behaviour.
