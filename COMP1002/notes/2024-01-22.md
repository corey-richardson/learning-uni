## Cyber Threats and Adversial Behaviours

1. Commercial data, business information, ransom money, espionage
2. Business data would now be public information, financial crime, disrupt services, potential loss of life ([Ambulance service hack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-66315690))
3. Businesses, individuals

## [Zeus (Malware)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(malware))

1. Trojan Attack
2. Microsoft Windows
3. Drive-by-downloads, phishing
4. Remote attack
5. Compromised accounts including banking accounts
6. Money.

## [British Airways Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_data_breach)

GDPR penalties can be upto 4% of annual global revenue.

BA's total worldwide revenue if 2017 was £12.23bn, so a potential fine of upto £489m. ICO fined BA £20m.

## Malware

### Virus

Non-autonomous program that replicates and spreads itself by infecting systems, programs or files.

### Worm

Code that is able to replicate and spread autonomously through systems and networks.

### Trojan Horse

A program containing unexpected hidden functionality, potentially operating alongside expected behaviour.

### Spyware

Parasitic software that invades users' privacy by gathering information.

## Malware Behaviour

### Infection

How and where users are likely to come into contact with malware

**Vectors:** <br>
- Email attachments
- Instant messaging
- P2P file sharing
- Exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities
- Comprimised websites (drive by downloads)
- Removable media

### Payload

Determines what the malware will actually do and represents the most variable aspect of behaviour.

### Defence

The ability of the malware to safeguard itself against detection and removal.

**Passive:** (Hiding)
- Stealth techniques
- Polymorphism and metamorphism

**Active Techniques:** (Attacking)
- Changing system config so security software doesn't run at start up
- Blocking access to antivirus vendors websites to prevent updates
- Terminating processes relating to AV and firewall processes

Brain virus (1986)
- intercepted any attempts to read the infected boot sector
- if anyone tried to inspect the disk, they would be presented with a copy of the original, uninfected boot sector

Gaobot worm (2005)
- blocked access to 35 security-related sites and had a list of over 420 different processes that it tried to terminate 

Shifu Trojan (2015)
- A banking Trojan, which affected Japanese banks and financial institutions in Aug/Sept 2015
- Based upon techniques reused from a variety of previously detected malware (e.g. Zeus, Conficker)
- Notably included its own anti-malware module to ward off other banking Trojans and ensure that it retains control of the compromised systems

## WannaCry

An example of Crypto Ransomware

Infection of 200,000 computers across 150 countries

Notable victim was the UK National Health Service, due to
continued use of unsupported (and hence unpatched) Windows XP
