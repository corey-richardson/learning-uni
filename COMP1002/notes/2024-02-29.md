## IP Subnetting

> A subnet, or subnetwork, is a segmented piece of a larger network. More specifically, subnets are a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments.

Subnetting provides levels of hierarchy; flat networking is difficult to manage.

Without subnetting, all broadcasts would propagate to the entire network.

Different user groups can use different subnets with different security rulesets.

Subnetworks are created within larger networks by dividing the available IP address space into smaller, manageable segments.

The "borrow network bits" method involces borrowing bits from the *host* portion of the IP address to create the subnet portion.
1. Identify the original network address
2. Determine the number of subnets needed
3. Calculate the number of bits needed to represent the required number of subnets
    - $2^n >= \text{number of subnets}$ where $n$ is the number of "borrowed bits"
4. Modify the subnet mask
    - Increase the subnet mask to include the additional bits borrowed for the subnet portion; this reduces the number of available hosts addresses per subnet.
    - The new subnet mask is determined by adding the borrowed bits to the original subnet mask.
    - If you are borrowing 3 bits, add 3 to the original subnet mask; "/24" -> "/27".
    - > When you see a subnet mask represented as "/24", it means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are dedicated to identifying the network, and the remaining 8 bits are available for addressing hosts within that network.

4 subnets, 62 hosts

- Determine the number of subnetworks
- Determine the number of hosts/subnetwork

`A.B.C.D/m` network, borrow $n$ bits
- $2^n$ subnets
- $2^{(32-m-n)}$ addresses/subnet
- $2^{(32-m-n)} - 2$ usable hosts

`141.163.0.0/16`, borrow $7$ bits
- $m=16$, $n=7$
- $2^7 = 128$ subnets
- $2^{(32-7-16)} = 2^9 = 512$ addresses/subnet
- $512 - 2 = 510$ usable hosts

### Variable Length Subnet Masking, VLSM

Reduces wastage.

Allows network administrators to divide an IP network into subnets of different sizes, each with its own subnet mask. This enables more efficient use of IP address space by allocating subnet masks of varying lengths to different subnets based on their specific requirements.

## IPv6

IPv4 has ran out.

IPv6 has more addresses; 128 bits.
- There are 4 billion IPv4 addresses
- There are 340 undecillion IPv6 addresses

Network Address Translation (NAT) isn't needed:
- a way to map multiple private addresses inside a local network to a public IP address before transferring the information onto the internet.

Smaller header, better security.

IPv6 has to coexist with IPv4; a recall of every IPv4 device would be impossible. Devices should support IPv4 AND IPv6; dual stack. If a network is IPv6 only, it also needs an IPv4 "tunnel network" to  encapsulate the IPv6 header within the IPv4 data.

### IPv6 Representation - Hextets

An IPv6 address is represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. e.g: <br>
`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

Leading zeros can be ommitted.

### IPv6 Communication

Unicast
- Identify an IPv6 interface

Multicast
- Send IPv6 packets to multiple destinations

Anycast
- Unicast address that can be assigned to multiple devices
- Packet routed to nearest such device

Broadcast Address
- No broadcast address in IPv6
- Replaced by an all-nodes multicast

### IPv6 Subnetting

No need to avoid wastage when you have $2^128$ addresses...

Subnetting is implemented for hierarchical reasons.

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, compared to the 32-bit length of IPv4 addresses. 

In IPv6 subnetting, prefix length notation is used to specify the number of leading bits in the network portion of the address. For example, an IPv6 address with a prefix length of /64 means that the first 64 bits represent the network portion, and the remaining bits are available for addressing hosts within that subnet.

IPv6 subnetting can be done by dividing the available address space into smaller subnets. This can be achieved by borrowing bits from the host portion of the address to create additional subnets. IPv6 generally uses a flat addressing structure with subnet masks of fixed lengths (/64 being the most common).
