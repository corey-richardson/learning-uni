# Ethical Hacking Demo

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Any public knowledge that is used in the reconnaissance stage.

*Maltego, Nessus, Nmap/Zenmap (nmap GUI), theHarvester, Sherlock*

## Footprinting

The technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to.

Active vs Passive

## Maltego

**Transforms:** bits of code which can be run to generate information based on information we already possess.

**Entity:** the information generated by the transform or provided by us

`SMB101 VPN`

## Port Scanning (Zenmap)

Nmap is a port scanner that discovers the active host by network scanning Port scanning with zenmap/ nmap to the Metasplotable VM and identify:
1. Opening ports
2. Running services (application name and version) this host is providing.
3. Operating systems and OS versions
4. Firewall in use.

## Vulnerability Scanning (Nessus)

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner which scans ports like Nmap and looks only for the specific weakness of the system against a known host.
