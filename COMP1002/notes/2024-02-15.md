# Transport Layer

- Transport Layer Service
- [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (User Datagram Protocol)
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

## Transport Services and Protocols

Provide *logical communication* between app processes running on different hosts.

Transport protocols run in end systems:
- Send Side: breaks app messages into segments and passes to the network layer
- Receive Side: reassembles segments into messages and passes to the application layer

More than one transport protocol is available to apps
- TCP
- UDP

> Network Layer: logical communication between *hosts* <br>
> Transports Layer: logic comminication between *processes*; relies on and enhances network layer services.

TCP
- Reliable, in-order delivery
- Congestion control, flow control, connection setup

UDP
- Unreliable, unordered delivery
- Simple extension of "best effort" IP

> The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly.

> TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

## Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

Multiplexing at sender
- Handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header

Demultiplexing at receiver
- Use header info to deliver segments to the correct socket
- Host receives IP datagram; each datagram has a source and destination IP address, each datagram carries one transport later segment, each segment has a source and destination port number
- Host uses *IP address* and *port numbers* to direct segments to the appropriate socket

> Socket: application process

Ports numbered 1-1023 are well known server ports

Ports >1024 are ephemeral [lasting for a very short time] ports

## UDP

- "Best effort" service, UDP segments may be lost or delivered out of order
- Connectionless -> no handshake between UDP sender and receiver
- No flow control
- No reliability

Network and processing overheads are low; only 8 bytes per header. FAST.

Use Cases:
- Streaming multimedia
    - Loss tolerant
    - Rate sensitive
    - DNS

Reliability can be added at application layer level; application specific error recovery.

Supports:
- Unicast; one-to-one
- Multicast; one-to-many
- Broadcast; one-to-all

UDP Segment Header
- Source Port
- Destination Port
- Length
- Checksum

## TCP

One sender, one receiver (connection)

Reliable, in-order byte stream
- no message boundaries

Pipelined
- TCP congestion and flow control
- Sender will not overwhelm the receiver

Full duplex data
- Bi-directional data flow in the same connection
- MSS: maximum segment size

Connection
- Handshaking: exchange of control messages
- Initialises sender and receiver state before the data exchange

**20-bytes WITHOUT options** (compared to 8-bytes for UDP)

- URG; Signifies that urgent data is being sent
- ACK; Acknowledge the receipt of data
- PSH; Push data row
- RST; Reset / Abort TCP session
- SYN; Establish a new TCP session
- FIN; Gracefully terminate a connection

### Connection Management

Connections established with 3-way handshakes

Client or server can terminate the connection `FIN`

### Reliability

Retransmission is triggered by
- Timeout event
- Duplicate acks

### Flow Control

Receiver has a *receive buffer*. Speed-matching service ensures sender won't overflow the buffer by transmitting too fast.

### Congestion Control

Too many transmissions for *network* to handle; this will cause loss of packets.

`cwnd` congestion window size

Sender increases transmission rate (window size), probing for usable bandwidth until a loss occurs.
- additive increase; `cwnd = cwnd + 1`
- multiplitive decrease; `cwnd = cwnd / 2`

Loss is inferred by 3 duplicate acks
