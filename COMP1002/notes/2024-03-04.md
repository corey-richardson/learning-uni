# Cryptography

Interception
- A message may be obtained and read by a third party (MITM), affecting *confidentiality*.

Modification or Substitution
- A message could be altered or entirely replaced, affecting *integrity*.

Blocking
- The message may be blocked, affecting *availability*.

Plaintext and Ciphertext

Cryptology = Cryptography + Cryptanalysis

Transposition
- Symbols in plaintext are moved into different positions in the cipher text

Substitution
- Symbols in plaintext are replaced in the cipher text

Concealment
- Additional symbols are oaced in the cipher text to conceal the contents

## Ceasar Cipher

> Substitution

$C=E(M) + K \,\,\, (\mod 26 \,\,\,)$

## Cryptanalysis

It's always assumed the attacker knows the cipher being used but does not know the key.

### Brute Force 

It would take a maximum of 25 attempts to brute force a Caesar Cipher; small keyspace.

### Statistical Analysis

Spaces in cipertext give sentence structure.

Guess repeated characters; letter frequency distribution.

## Cryptographic Techniques

### Product Ciphers

Combine two or more basic methods; strong ciphers from weak methods.

### One-Time Pad

A key sequence at least as long as the plain text.

It is a perfect cipher system in the sense that no matter how much computational power you have, you cannot break the cipher text.

Difficult to use in applications which consume a large amount of key material.

Only provides condifentiality, not data integrity.

> Requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is larger than or equal to the size of the message being sent. <br>
> In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.[1]

> The problems of secure key distribution make them impractical for most applications.

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms

![](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Symmetric-Encryption.png)

> Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext. <br>
> The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys.

> The requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric-key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric-key encryption). <br>
> However, symmetric-key encryption algorithms are usually better for bulk encryption. With exception of the one-time pad they have a smaller key size, which means less storage space and faster transmission. <br> 
> Due to this, asymmetric-key encryption is often used to exchange the secret key for symmetric-key encryption.

Asymmetric cryptography solves the key distribution problem.
- Messages for a user are encrypted using freely available *public keys*.
- Can only be decrypted using the *private key* known only to the user and never shared.
- Knowledge of the public key does not give any clues to the private key.

### Public Key Cryptography

$\text{User}_1$ | $\text{User}_2$

$\text{User}_1$ generates two keys:
- The public key, $K_A$
- The secret key, ${K_A}^{-1}$

$\text{User}_2$ only has the public key $K_A$. Although $\text{User}_1$ can easily generate this keypair, it will be difficult for $\text{User}_2$ who only has $K_A$ to be able to generate ${K_A}^{-1}$.

$\text{User}_1$ can publish their public key freely. 

$\text{User}_2$ can use $K_A$ to create and encrypt a message using $\text{User}_1$'s public key.

$$C=E_{K_A}(M)$$

$\text{User}_1$ uses their private key to decrypt the message. 

$$M=D_{{K_A}^{-1}}(C)$$

### Public Key Generation

- Interger Factorisation Problem
- Discrete Logarithm Problem
- Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem

> None of these mathematical problems have been *proven* to be intractable; not easily controlled or directed. However, they are *believed* to be intractable; years of study have failed to yield efficient algorithmic solutions to solve them.

### One Way Hash Function

To ensure integrity, a mechanism is required that can create a "fingerprint" of the data.

Hash functions allow us to take a variable length input and produce a fixed length output that *uniquely* fingerprints the input.

> A one-way hash function, also known as a message digest, is a mathematical function that takes a variable-length input string and converts it into a fixed-length binary sequence that is computationally difficult to invertâ€”that is, generate the original string from the hash.

- Given $M$, it is easy to compute $h$.
- Given $h$, it is difficult to compute $M$.
- Given $M$, it is difficult to find another message, $M'$ such that $H(M)=H(M')$; strong collision resistance.

**Birthday Attack**
- An adversary wants to find two random messages, $M$ and $M'$ where $H(M)=H(M')$
- Finding two messages that hash to the same value would require $2^{m/2}$ random messages
- A 64-bit hash would take a machine capable of 1 million hashes per second around 1 hour to find a pair of messages.

**Collision Attack**
- Given $H(M)$, an adversary creates another message $M'$ such that $H(M)=H(M')$
- Finding a message that hashes to a given hash requires $2^m$ random messages
- A 64-bit hash would take a machine capable of 1 million hashes per second around 600,000 years to find a second message.

### Message Authentication Codes, MAC

A key dependent one way hash function
- Same operation as a one-way hash function except only someone with the key is able to verify the hash
- Provides *authenticity* to the messages, does not provide *confidentiality*

A person could use a MAC to ensure the files have not been altered.

Symmetric key

Any MAC can be made into a One Way Hash Function by making the key public

### Digital Signature

IF messages $E$ and $D$ are inverses of each other, they can be used for message *authenticity* as well as *confidentiality*.

$$S=D_{{K_A}^{-1}}(M)$$
$$M=E_{K_A}(S)$$

This decryption $S$ is usually called a digital signature

### Using Keys

Required Action               | Who's key | Key Type
---                           | ---       | ---
Sending an encrypted message  | Receiver  | Public
Sign a message                | Sender    | Private
Decrypt an encrypted message  | Receiver  | Private
Authenticate a signed message | Sender    | Public

### Key Distribution

- Where are keys generated?
- How are keys generated?
- Where are keys stored?
- How do they get there?
- Where are the keys actually used?
- How are keys revoked and replaced?

## Cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is the science of recovering plaintext from ciphertext *without access to the key*. Successful cryptanalysis may yield the key.
- Secrecy must reside in the key and not the algorithm
- The cryptanalyst has complete details of the cryptographic algorithm (worst case assumption)
- In a real world situation it is unlikely the attacker has so much information, however if the cryptanalyst is unable to break the algorithm *with* knowledge of the system, it is unlikely an attacker can break it without this knowledge.
