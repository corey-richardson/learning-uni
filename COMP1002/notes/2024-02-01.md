# Protocol Layers and Application Layer

- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Network File Transfer (NFS)

No layering: each new application had to be reimplemented for each network layer.

- Introduce an intermediate layer that provides a unique abstraction for various network technologies.

1. Application
- Supporting network applications
- FTP, SMTP, HTTP

2. Transport
- Process-process data transfer
- TCP, UDP

3. Network
- Routing of datagrams from source to destination
- IP, routing protocols

4. Link
- Data transfer between neighbouring network elements
- Ethernet, 802.11 (WiFi), PPP

5. Physical
- Bits on the wire.

**Client-Server Architecture**
- Server:
    - always-on host
    - permanent IP address
    - data centers for scaling
- Clients:
    - communicate with server
    - may be intermittently connected
    - may have dynamic IP addresses
    - do not communicate directly with each other

**Peer-2-Peer (P2P) Architecture**
- no always-on server
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
- peers are intermittently connected

data integrity
- some apps (e.g., file transfer,
web transactions) require
100% reliable data transfer
- other apps (e.g., audio) can
tolerate some loss

timing
- some apps (e.g., Internet
telephony, interactive
games) require low delay
to be “effective”

throughput
- some apps (e.g.,
multimedia) require
minimum amount of
throughput to be
“effective”
- other apps (“elastic apps”)
make use of whatever
throughput they get

security
- encryption, data integrity,
…
