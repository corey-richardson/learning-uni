- *Authentication*
- Authorisation
- Accountability

Users must be identified within the system to enable user-specific access controls and individual accountability for actions.

*Claimed* identities must be authenticated to verify the legitimacy of these claims. Authentication is the first line of defense for a system, preventing unauthorised access and misuse of the systems resources. Robust authentication machanisms offer protection against unauthorised access by external entities and privilege misuse by insiders.

Often, authentication is not just for security, but to enable the provider to track usage. For instance, a login system may be designed more to monitor user behavior and gather data for analytics rather than prioritising the protection of the user's assets or sensitive information. As a consequence, users often find themselves burdened with managing numerous accounts across various platforms without experiencing tangible personal benefits in terms of enhanced security. The consequences of this increase the risk of security breaches, even on other sites, due to password reuse (password fatigue).

> The focus on tracking usage rather than prioritising user security can lead to a situation where users bear the brunt of managing multiple accounts without significant security advantages.

## Authentication Factors

- The user *knows* something: passwords and PINs.
- The user *has* something: ID card, YubiKey, token.
- The user *is* something: biometrics.

Passwords and PINs are the baseline methods. They have recognised weaknesses and limitations but it is hard to go beyond them as stronger approaches require additional technologies:
- Biometrics: fingerprint, face, voice, iris
- Tokens: YubiKeys, smart cards, RSA SecurID

You cannot rely on a user to have these technolgies *unless the service provider supplies them*, so the baseline method is often used.

### Passwords

Pros
- Easy to understand; straightfoward concept
- Familiarity from other systems
- Versatile; can be implemented on a wide range of systems and contexts

Cons
- Hard to manage properly; memorability
- Inconvinient to use, especially for 'strong' passwords

Passwords are often
- Badly selected
- Easy to predict
- Too short
- Dictionary words
    - Vulnerable to password cracking
- Include personal data
    - Vulnerable to social engineering
- Infrequently (or never) changes
- Written down to remember them
- Used multiple times for different systems
- Point-of-entry authentication (only at the start of a session)
- Shared
- Forgotten

National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Password Guidelines
- 3 random words
- Don't use personal information
    - e.g. pets name

Improving password systems involves
- Encouraging better selection
- Password aging
- Password filtering
- Preventing password reuse
- System generated passwords
- One-time passwords

All of these suggestions decrease user friendliness.

Communications Electronics Security Group (CESG) guidance suggest *against* the practice of forcing regular password changes; memorability causes users to pick simpler passwords if they have to remember a new password every 3 months. Users are more likely to write down their current password. Instead, they advise other safeguards to compensate for this, including showing the time of last sign-in to alert users to any account compromise.

Every aspect of good password practice makes them more difficult to use.

### Cognitive Challenges (Security Questions)

Factual questions ("What street did you grow up on?") is more reliable than subjective questions ("What is your favourite hobby?") as opinions may change over time and cause users to provide incorrect responses. 

Offered questions must cater to all individuals; not all users had a childhood pet. You could allow users to set their own questions but there is a risk they choose simple questions other would know ("What is your first name?"). Therefore its preferable to have a large-set of preset questions. Still vulnerable to an imposter with intimate knowledge of the user, or social engineering.

### Graphical / Image Based Methods

Images are easier to remember than strings of characters. Methods that present images to the user to enable *recognition* rather than precise *recall* as is the case for passwords.

Remembering a sequence of images 
- Déjà Vu requires users to remember a series of photos or abstract images
- PassImages uses pictures of everyday items
- Passfaces relies upon recognition of a series of faces
- DynaHand relies upon users ability to recognize pictures of their own signature

Remembering something about an image
- areas or points within a picture (e.g. PixelPin)

Requiring the user to draw an image
- a method in which the 'password' was a simple picture drawn on a grid

Android Pattern Unlock
- Suited to touch screen devices
- More observable than PINs
- Potential 'clues' from greasy fingers

### Online Banking

"Please enter the 1st, 6th and 3rd digit of your PIN."

More time-consuming and requires more cognitive effort than a password. The user can no longer rely on the auto-pilot / reflex response of typing their PIN.

## Token-based Authentication

Possession of a physical identifier, often combined with secret-based authentication to form 2FA. 

![](https://support.yubico.com/hc/article_attachments/360011846079)

Pros
- Reduces the impact of password theft
- Users cannot share their access privileges
- An attacker must counterfeit or steal a token
- Increased awareness of likely comprimise (token is missing, uh oh)
- Illegal possession of a token can be used as evidence of a compromise attempt

Cons
- More expensive to implement
- Tokens can still be lost or stolen

## Biometrics

Authentication based on something the user *is*.

Nothing for the user to remember or physically lose (apart from finger dismemberment).

> "A measurable biological (anatomical and physiological) and behavioral characteristic that can be used for automated recognition"

> "The automated use of physiological or behavioral characteristics to determine or verify identity"

Uniqueness
- The ability to successfully discriminate people

Universal
- The ability for a technique to be applied to a whole population of users

Permanence
- The ability for a characteristic to not change with time

Collectable
- The ease which a sensor is able to collect the sample

Acceptable
- The degree to which a technique is found to be acceptable to a person

Circumventable
- The ability not to duplicate or copy a sample

Physiological | Behavioural
--- | ---
Fingerprint Recognition | Speaker Recognition
Vascular Pattern Recognition | Signature Recognition
Iris Scanning | Keystroke Analysis
Retinal Scanning | Mouse Dynamics
Facial Recognition | Gait Recognition
Facial Thermogram | Stylometry
Ear print | 
Hand Geometry |

Most prominent growth has been on mobile devices.

### Error Rates and Operational Factors

False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
- Errors where impostors are falsely believed to be legitimate users 

False Rejection Rate (FRR)
- Errors where the system falsely identifies the legitimate user as an impostor

Failure to Enroll
- Errors in which the system is unable to establish a biometric template for a proposed user

Failure to Acquire
- Errors in which the system is unable to successfully acquire the information required to make a decision

Presentation attack: Fake artefacts (false fingerprint) like using a plaster cast of a finger.
- Counter measure: liveliness detection like detecting conductivity properties of human skin; oxygen levels of the blood in the finger; pulse measurements

Replay attack: A stored signal is replayed into the system ignoring the sensor, like replaying an old copy of a fingerprint image (bypassing the sensor or step 1 in verification).
- Counter measure: authenticate the sensor using challenge / response approach

Spoofing template (step 4 in Enrollment): fake one or more biometric templates in the database. As a result, either a fake identity is authorized or a rightful user face a denial of service.
- Counter measure: protect the database with strong authentication/ authorization

FaceID reverts to PIN/password in low light; not universal. 

Liveness detection and attention awareness
- cannot be used when you are asleep or dead

Not just at Point-of-Entry
- Payments, password autofill, in-app authentication

## Single Sign On

With SSO, users only need to log in once using a single set of credentials (such as a username and password) to gain access to a range of interconnected systems or applications.

Once authenticated, users can seamlessly access various software systems without the need to repeatedly log in or provide their credentials for each individual system.

SSO operates on a trust-based model between the application, often referred to as the service provider, and an identity provider. The identity provider is responsible for authenticating users' identities and providing the necessary authentication tokens or assertions to the service provider, which grants access based on this trusted information.

SSO enhances user experience by eliminating the need to remember multiple sets of credentials and reducing the time spent on logging in.

While SSO simplifies access for users, it also offers enhanced security benefits. By centralizing authentication through a trusted identity provider, security measures can be more effectively implemented and monitored, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Session, Cookies and Token

HTTP sessions enable web servers to maintain user identity and store user-specific data throughout multiple interactions between a client application (such as a web browser) and a web application. Essentially, when a user logs into a website, an HTTP *session* is established, allowing the server to recognize the user across multiple page visits or interactions within the same browsing session. This enables the server to maintain personalized experiences and track user activity.

HTTP cookies are small pieces of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website. These cookies are then stored on the user's computer or device by their web browser. Cookies serve various purposes, such as remembering user preferences, storing login credentials, and tracking user behavior across different pages or sessions on a website. They can be either session cookies (temporary and deleted when the browser is closed) or persistent cookies (stored for a longer period).

Authentication tokens, also known as security tokens, are hardware or software devices used to enhance security when accessing an application or network system. These tokens are typically generated during the authentication process after the user successfully logs in. They serve as proof of the user's identity and authorization to access the system. Authentication tokens can take various forms, including physical hardware tokens (like key fobs), software-based tokens (such as one-time passwords generated through mobile apps), or cryptographic tokens exchanged between client and server during secure communication.
