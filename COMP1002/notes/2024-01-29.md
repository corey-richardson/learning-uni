Local Area Networks:
- Small networks of close-by computers (usually one geographical site)
- Used to share resources (storage, printer)

Ethernet:
- Series of computers connected by a single central cable.
- Data goes to ALL computers on the network; MAC address used to identify target computer
- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Rate at which a carrier can transmit data is called the bandwidth
- As network traffic increases, the probability that two computers will attempt to share their data at the same time increases; collision.
- After a collision, the computer will wait a random (but still short) time before attempting to retransmit; if all the computers on the network had the same delay period then the collision would just keep occuring. 
- If it collides again, it will increase the wait time; Exponential Backoff.
- The network can be split into 'collision domains' using switches.

User Datagram Protocol - *UDP*

Transmission Control Protocol - *TCP*

- Idempotency  Token (Unique identifier so action is only fulfilled once)

Domain Name System - *DNS*
