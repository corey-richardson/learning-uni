## Link Layer

Hosts and routers are *nodes*.

Communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along the communication paths are *links*.
- Wired links
- Wireless links
- LANs

Layer-2 packet: *frames*, encapsulate the datagram.

Data-link layer has the repsonsibility of transferring datagrams from one node to *physically adjacent* nodes over a link.

### Services

Framing, link access
- When transmitting data over a network, information is organised into packets called *datagrams*.
- The datagrams need to be encapsulated into *frames*; header and trailer.
- Header contains source/dest address, etc.
- Trailer often contains error-checking data.
- In a shared medium environment (i.e. Ethernet) where multiple devices are connected to the same network, there needs to be a method for controlling access to the network channel.
- MAC Addresses are used in the frame headers to identify the source and destination of the data being transmitted.
- > Media Access Control (MAC): Unique identifiers assigned to each Network Interface Card (NIC) or device.
- MAC Addresses are specific to the local network and only used for communication within a network segment. IP addresses are used for internetwork communication.

Reliable delivery between adjacent nodes
- Ensuring data sent between neighbouring nodes is accurate and without errors.
- The transport layer of the OSI model provides mechanisms for reliable data delivery such as TCP.
- TCP is designed to ensure reliable delivery between communication nodes via features such as error detection, retransmission of lost packets, packet ordering.
- *Low bit-error links* such as fibre optic cables or certain twisted-pair/coaxial cables have low error rates and rarely experience errors or data corruption.
- *High bit-error links* such as wireless links have higher error rates due to factors like signal interference, attenuation and environmental conditions.
- Given these high error rates, protocols and techniques are implemented to correct errors *locally* instead of relying on higher level protocols such as TCP.
- Lower level protocols are implemented at the link layer such as Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) to detect and correct errors closer to where they occur, improving reliability of data transmission over wirless links.

## Multiple Access Protocols

### Multiple Access Links: Protocols

Two types of *links*:
- Point-to-point
    - P2P link between Ethernet switch and host
    - > In a local area network (LAN) setup, each device (such as a computer or server) is typically connected to an Ethernet switch via a point-to-point link. Each link between a device and the switch forms a dedicated connection, allowing for efficient data transmission.
    - > In telecommunications, point-to-point links are common in serial communication setups, where data is sent directly from one device to another over a serial cable or connection.
- Broadcast
    - Shared wire of medium
    - Old-fashioned ethernet
    - > In traditional Ethernet networks, such as 10BASE5 (thick coaxial) or 10BASE2 (thin coaxial), all devices are connected to a single shared medium (the coaxial cable). Any data transmitted by one device is received by all other devices on the network segment.
    - 802.11 Wireless LAN
    - > Wi-Fi networks operate on the principle of broadcast links, where wireless access points broadcast data to all devices within range. Devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network can receive data packets transmitted by the access point, enabling wireless communication among multiple devices.

On a single shared broadcast channel, two or more simultaneous transmissions can cause interference. There is a *collision* if a node receives two or more signals at the same time.

Multiple Access Protocol
- A distributed algorithm that determines how nodes can share a channel and when a node can transmit data to that channel.
- Communications about channel sharing must use the channel itself.
- The multiple access protocol is designed as a distributed algorithm; no central point of authority to manage access to the channel. Instead, each node independently follows a set of rules or procedures to coordinate their transmissions based on information it gathers from the shared channel.

### Random Access Protocols

- When a node has a packet to send it will attempt to transmit it at the full data rate, $R$, using the entire available bandwidth for its transmission.
- Unlike coordinated access methods where nodes schedule transmissions, random access protocols do not require nodes to coordinate their transmissions in advance. Instead the nodes will contend for access to the channel whenever they have data to send.
- If two or more nodes attempt transmission simultaneously resulting in a collision, the random access MAC protocol will detect a collision.
- Detection of a collision usually involves monitoring the channel for signs of activity while transmitting and comparing the transmitted signal with what is received.
- A common approach for collision recovery is to introduce a random delay/backoff period for the retransmission after a collision is detected.
- *Carrier Sense Multiple Access* (CSMA) is a random access MAC protocol commonly used in Ethernet networks.
- CSMA has the transmitting nodes "sense" the channel before starting their transmission to see if the channel is busy.
- Due to propagation delays, collions may still occur is two or more nodes simultaneously detect that the channel is idle before starting their transmission.

*Collision Detection*
- If no data signal is "sensed" on the channel, transmit the data.
- If the channel is busy, wait for it to be idle.
- Ethernet

*Collision Avoidance*
- If the channel is idle, transmit a notification of intent to use it and *then* transmit the data.

## LANs, MAC Addresses and ARP

The MAC address is used locally to facilitate communication between devices on the same physical network. Also known as LAN address, physical address or Ethernet address.

Each adapter on a LAN has a unique LAN address.

The allocation of MAC addresses is overseen by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); they define format standards and manage the assignment of unique addresses.

MAC addresses consist of 48-bits (12 bytes) in hexadecimal format, e.g. `B4-96-91-76-09-AD`.

The first 24-bits of a MAC address represent the Organisationally Unique Identifier. This identifiers the manufacturer or organisation that owns the device.
- `B4-96-91` indicates Intel Corporation

The remaining 24-bits are specific to the Network Interface Controller (NIC)

The flat address format offers portability; a LAN card with a MAC address can be moved between LANs without reconfiguration. The MAC address remains the same no mateter with network the device connects to. 

In contrast, IP addresses are *not* portable. They are hierarchical and tied to the subnet which the node is attached to. When moving a device between networks, its IP address may need to be reconfigured.

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table is used by each device on a LAN to maintain a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses allowing communication to local devices from outside of the network.
> Data is routed using IP addresses but delivered at the data link layer using MAC addresses.

Each entry in the ARP table contains:
- IP Address
- MAC Address
- TTL (Time To Live)
    - How long the mapping is retained in the ARP table
    - Once the TTL expires, the entry may be removed from the table to clear space for new entries.
    - Default value of 20 minutes, but true value varies by network.

When a device needs to communicate with another device on the LAN, it checks the ARP table to see if it has the MAC address mapping for the destination IP address.
- If the mapping is valid (exists and is not expired), the device can use the MAC address to directly encapsulate and deliver the data.
- If the mapping is not valid, the device sends an ARP request broadcast to the LAN, asking the target address to respond with its MAC address.
- When it receives a response, it will update the ARP table with the new IP:MAC mapping and use it for the following communication.

Nodes create their ARP table without intervention from a network administrator.

### Ethernet

The dominant wired LAN technology.

- It can be implemented on a single chip making it suitable for various types of devices, from desktops to servers and network appliances. 
- It can support multiple speeds on this one chip, ranging from the original 10Mbps to the modern 10Gbps: adaptability.
- Affordable and simple making it accessible for a range of applications and industries.
- Scalable
- Ethernet is standardised by the IEEE to ensure interoperability between different vendors.

Frame Structure:
- The sending adapter encapsualtes the IP datagram into an *ethernet frame*.
- The *preamble* contains 7 bytes (56 bits) with a repeating pattern of `10101010` concluding with a single 1 byte sequence of `10101011` to indicate the end of the preamble and start of the actual frame's data.
- 8 bytes (64 bits) in long total
- The preamble is used to signal the start of the frame and synchronise the reveiver's clock with that of the sender.
- The next 12 bytes are for the destination and source MAC *addresses* (6 bytes each).
- When an adapter receivers a frame, it checks whether the destination MAC address matches its own address OR if it is a broadcast address, such as an ARP packet.
- If the destination address matches, it will pass the data within the frame to the network layer for further processing.
- The *type* field indicating the higher layer protocol to which the data should be delivered to. Usually this is IP but can be other less common protocols such as Novell IPX or AppleTalk.
- The *Cyclic Redundancy Check* (CRC) is performed on the receiver side to detect errors in the frame. It involves a mathematical calculation based on the frames contents (checksum).
- If errors are detected during the CRC, the frame is dropped to prevent the transmission of errorneous data further up the network stack.

## Switches

Segmentation of Networks into Seperate Collion Domains
- Switches segment networks into seperate collision domains to reduce the likliehood of collisions, resulting in improved network performance and efficiency.

Dedicated Bandwidth
- Switches provide dedicated bandwidth for each port, offering dedicated communication between devices. This ensures devices can communicate simulteously without causing collisions. 

Full-Duplex Operation
- Switches support full-duplex operation, allowing devices to transmit and data at the same time. This effectively doubles the available bandwidth and improves network performance.

Selective Forwarding
- Based on destination MAC address
- Switches use a forwarding table containing pairs of learned MAC addresses and their corresponding ports. When a switch receives a frame it will examine the destination MAC address to determine the outgoing port. It then forwards the frame only to that port rather than broadcasting it to all ports.

Switches provide efficient and intelligent network connectivity.

### Switch States

Learning
- The switch examines the source MAC address in the header when it receives a frame.
- If the switch already has an entry in the table for this Port:Source_MAC pair it will update the aging timer associated with that entry. This timer trakcs how long since the switch last saw a frame from that MAC address on that port.
- If there is no existing entry for the port, the switch adds a new entry to its table, recording the port and the source MAC address.

Aging
- The switch periodically checks the aging timer for each entry.
- If a timer expires, the switch will remove that entry from its table to clear space for new space, preventing the table from becoming cluttered with outdated information.

Flooding
- If the switch receives a frame with a destination MAC address with no entry its table, it employs a flooding mechanism.
- The switch forwards the frame out of all ports except for the one on which it arrived from.
- This ensures that the frame reaches its destination, even when the switch doesn't know the specific port it should be forwarded to.

Filtering
- The switch performs checks on incoming frames, including verifying the CRC checksum to validate integrity.
- It can also implement security measures such as MAC address filtering where it will only forward frames from authorised MAC addresses, and drop frame from unauthorised MAC addresses. 

### Remote Management of a Switch

Configure via a console port
- Connect to the switch using a console cable and terminal emulation software (such as HyperTerminal), using the switch's CLI for configuration.

Assign an IP address to the Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)
- The switch needs an IP address to enable remote management.
- The IP address acts as a management interface for the switch.
- The SVI is associated with a specific VLAN, a logical grouping of switches.
- VLANs segregate network traffic to logically partition the switch into multiple broadcast domains.
- By default, all switch ports are memebers of VLAN 1.

Cisco IOS Configuration Example
```
enable
configure terminal
interface vlan 1
ip address <IP_ADDRESS> <SUBNET_MASK>
no shutdown
exit
```
*ALWAYS* use Secure Shell (SSH) to remotely access a switch. If using TELNET, username and password is sent as clear text.

### Configure SSH

1. Verify SSH support
- `show ip ssh`
- If IOS has no cyrptographic features, the command is unrecognised.
2. Configure the IP domain
- `ip domain-name <domain-name>`
3. Generate RSA key pairs
- `crypto key generate rsa`
- `crypto key zeroise rsa` is used to delete the RSA key pair, the SSH server is automatically disabled.
5. Verify SSH status to check SSH is enabled and functioning properly
- `show ip ssh`

## Hierarchical Network Model

A design framework used to organise and structure network architectures in a hierarchical manner. 

Divides the network into (usually 3) discrete layers: access, distibution and core. Each layer provides specific functions that define its role within the overall network. 

Seperation provides a modular design, allowing scalability.

### Access Layer

> Edge Layer, User Access Layer

Connect devices to the network and control which are allowed to communicate on the network. Interfaces with end devices.

Network Switches or Access Points provide access to the rest of the network.

Access Layer switches implement features such as VLANs to logically segregate traffic and enforce security policies.

This layer aggregates traffic from end devices and forwards to the distribution layer.

### Distribution Layer

Acts as an intermediary between the access and core layers, providing connectivity between access layer switches and aggregating network traffic from multiple access layer switches.

Performs functions such as VLAN routing, policy enforcement and access control. Ensures efficient traffic distribution through techniques such as load balancing and redundancy through technologies such as EtherChannel and link aggregation.

Responsible for segmenting broadcast domains and isolating network problems to prevent them from spreading throughout the network.

### Core Layer

The core layer is the backbone of the network and provides high-speed connectivity between distribution layer devices and network backbone connections.

Its primary function is to facilitate fast and efficient data transport across the network. It achieves this by minimizing latency, maximizing bandwidth, and ensuring high availability.

Devices at the core layer typically include high-speed routers and switches optimized for high throughput and minimal latency. Redundancy and fault tolerance are crucial aspects of the core layer design to ensure network reliability.

The core layer is responsible for routing packets between different distribution layer devices and connecting the network to external networks or the internet.
