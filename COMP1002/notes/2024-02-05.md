# Social Engineering and Phishing

Techniques that exploit human weaknesses and manipulate people into breaking security procedures.

Overlaps into the worlds of psychology, confidence tricksters, and behavioural manipulation.

Often easier to exploit the users of a system rather than the technology itself.

## Cialdini's Principles

**Authority**
- the attacker achieves the desired response from the target by making an assertion of authority

**Commitment and consistency**
- targets are likely to act consistently with past behaviour, and in accordance with things they have committed to

**Liking and similarity**
- the attacker exploits the fact that targets are more likely to respond to someone they like, or perceive to be similar to themselves; or a brand they are familiar with

**Reciprocation**
- the target is given something, in the hope that they feel obliged to reciprocate by giving something in return

**Scarcity**
- the target is led to believe that something they desire is in short supply or only available for a limited period. They may then feel obliged to act quickly and possibly without sufficient prior thought

**Social validation**
- targets may base their decision upon the behaviour of others (increasing the chances of a request being complied with by claiming that other people have already done the same thing)

## Vectors

- Over the phone; tech support, card fraud department, customer helpline
- Physically (in person); service engineer, dropped USB drive trick
- Email; malware, phishing

### Physical Sources

- Dumpster Diving (bin raiding); Technical documentation, Internal telephone directories, Product packaging
- Talking to people; gradually gather a base of knowledge

### Online Sources

- Social networks and websites can provide information for targeted attacks
- Spear-phishing attacks could be framed around: Interests expressed on Facebook profiles, Themes and opinions raised in tweets, Workplace information gathered from company webpages

Used 'social engineering' methods to encourage users to open (and thereby execute) a malicious attachment

## [Seasonal Striptease](https://www.theregister.com/2007/12/27/storm_worm_seasonal_attacks/)

Attacks will often attempt to exploit current events or news stories

On Christmas Eve 2007 an email was widely distributed using a variety of message titles

All directed users to a website claiming to contain a Santa Claus themed striptease

## Phishing

Attempts to dupe users into divulging sensitive information

Attacks traditionally targeted personal data relating to the user

A combination of social engineering and technology-based deception that attempts to dupe users into divulging sensitive information

Many phishing messages are sent in a very generic manner (i.e. indiscriminate mass-mailing, spamming)

Other phishing attacks are more
targeted
- Spear-phishing
- Whaling

The abundance of personal and business information online already makes it easier to target the attacks

### Scammer Grammar

For many, the poor use of grammar can be an indication that a message is bogus

However, it can also be used as a deliberate technique by the scammers to filter out the more alert users; those that still follow the link may be less educated, and therefore more vulnerable to exploitation 

### Reporting Phishing Scams

Suspect emails can be forwarded to the APWG (anti phishing working group)

`reportphishing@antiphishing.org`

And/or directly to the organisation that is being spoofed, e.g.

`spoof@paypal.com`
