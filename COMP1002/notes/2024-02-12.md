# DNS, Network Configurations

## Domain Name System

- Distributed Database: hierarchy of many name servers
- Application-layer protocol: hosts, name servers communicate to resolve names (address/name translation)

Host name to IP address translation; host aliasing, mail server aliasing

Load distributions: many IP addresses correspond to one name

Distribution prevents:
- Single point of failure
- Traffic volume overload
- A distant centralised database
- Maintenance
- ALL SCALING ISSUES

### Root Name Servers

Root name servers are contacted by the local name server; not the local client computer.

1. Contacts authoritative name server if name mapping not known
2. Gets mapping
3. Returns mapping to local name server

### TLD, Top Level Domain Servers

Responsible for `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, etc; all top level country domains.

Network Solutions maintains servers for `.com` TLD. Educause for `.edu`.

### Authoritative DNS Servers

Organsiations own DNS server, providing authoritative IP to hostname mappings for the organisations named hosts.

### Local DNS Name Server

Does not strictly belong to hierarchy.

Each ISP (residential ISP, company, university) has
one.

> Also called Default Name Server

### Resolving

Iterated Query
- contacted server replies with name of server to contact

Recursive Query
- puts burden of name resolution on contacted name server

### Caching and Updating Records

Once a name server learns a mapping, it will *cache* the map.

Cache entries will timeout after a time; *TTL*, Time To Live.

TLD servers are cached in the local name server so the root name server does not need to be visited.

Cached entries can be out of date if the associated IP address changes until the TTL timesout.

### Resource Records

DNS is a distributed database storing *resource records*.

`RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)`

`type=A`
- name is hostname
- value is IP address

`type=NS`
- name is domain (e.g. `foo.com`)
- value is hostname of authoritative name server for this domain

`type=CNAME`
- name is alias name for some "canonical" (the real) name
- `www.ibm.com` is really `servereast.backup2.ibm.com`
- value is canonical name

`type=MX`
- value is name of mailserver associated with name

### DNS Protocol, Messages

*Query* and *reply* messages, both with same message format

**Message Header:**
- Identification
    - 16 bit # for query, reply to query uses same #
- Flags
    - query or reply
    - recursion desired
    - recursion available
    - reply is authoritative
