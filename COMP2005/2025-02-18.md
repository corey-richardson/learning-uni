# Integration and System Testing

## Integration Testing

Individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.

Occurs after unit testing but before system testing.

Takes modules which have been unit tested as inputs, and groups them in larger aggregates.

## Designing Integration Tests

Combine unit tested modules 1 by 1. Test the *functionality* of combined units; not the NFRs.

1. Analyse interactions between system components
2. Decide on the integration testing approach
3. Design test cases & establish each test case input
4. Compare test results & track defects
5. Repeat above steps until complete system tested

Test complexity increases rapidly with number of interactions between components. Each component can depend on further system components, so the number can grow exponentially.

Bi-directional interactions are tested seperately.
- Test `A->B` then Test `B->A`

Dependencies and Interfaces
- Explicit Dependency: component A calls component B
- Implicit Dependency: components share a resource

## Integration Testing Approaches

### Big Bang Approach

All modules and units are tested at the same time.

Individual modules are integrated and tested when *everything* is ready.

The system is integrated without any *formal* integration testing.

Defects are identified at a very late stage. Very difficult to isolate defects. Highly likely to miss critical defects. More difficult to design effective test cases.

### Incremental Approach

- Top-Down Approach
- Bottom-Up Approach
- Sandwich Approach (combination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up)

#### Top-Down Integration

Top-Down Approach. Breaking down the system into compositional sub-systems.

![](https://www.lambdatest.com/dynamic-pages/resources/images/system's-hierarchy-integration-testing.png)

Test integration between the higher level components.

Lower level components are simulated with **stubs**.

When the code is ready, stubs are replaced with actual components.

#### Bottom-Up Integration

Piecing together of sub-systems to produce larger systems.

Test low-level components with no dependencies, then work up the hierarchy.

Calling components are simulated with drivers. When the code is ready, drivers are replaced with the actual modules.

The interaction between the components is clear, as components are added in a controlled manner and tested repetitively.

## Sandwich Approach

![](https://testsigma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Slide-16_9-48.png)

A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches concurrently. The system to be tested has three layers.

- objective layer in the centre
- layer over the objective called the top layer
- layer underneath the objective called the bottom layer

## When to Run Integration Tests

During development:
- near the end of the user story development
- could just run tests relating to user stories currently under development, if the system is segmented properly.

Continuous Integration Pipeline
- Continual running of tests
- Avoids taking up too much development time as defects would be fixed rapidly

## Best Practices

1. Integrate early and integrate often
2. Do not test business logic with integration tests
3. Keep test suites separate
4. Log extensively
5. Follow the test plan

## System Testing

Validates the complete and fully integrated software product. Evaluates the end-to-end system specification.

In the SDLC, software has been run in programming development environment. Software needs to be tested and run in the users' environment.

Investigate the functional and non-functional requirements.

Simulate the real environments as closely as possible.

## Exploratory Testing

Hands-on approach 
- testers involved in minimum planning and maximum test execution
- detailed specification not required
- good for examining new or unknown features
- test quality depends on tester's experience
- difficult to reproduce

## Session-Based Exploratory Testing

Time boxed uninterrupted testing session focused on a particular goal.

1. Tester (individually or paired) describes test objective and strategy 2-3 in short sentences
2. Session is time-boxed & divided into phases:
    - Setup
    - Test design
    - Execution
    - Defect localisation and reporting
3. Session is recorded in session sheet

## Automated System Testing

Having automated system test framework difficult because:
1. Test results difficult to analyse automatically
2. Some test cases may require manual intervention (UI)

## Non-Functional Testing

Load Testing
- Measure system against increasing load
- e.g. increasing numbers of parallel users or database transactions

Performance Testing
- Measuring processing speed & response times for specific use cases

Volume Testing/Stress Testing
- Observing system behaviour while handling large files or when being overloaded

Security Testing
- Test against unauthorised system or data access (Pen Testing)

Reliability & stability testing under continuous use
- I e.g., the number of system failures per hour

Compatibility and data conversion testing
- Interoperability with existing systems
- Data import-export processes

Robustness Testing
- Cases include misuse, programming errors, hardware failures
- Error handling and recovery

Configuration Testing
- Different OS versions and hardware platforms
- Different languages
