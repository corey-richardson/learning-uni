# Unit Testing

1. Unit Testing Principles
2. Testing with JUnit
3. Mock Objects

In Unit Testing, each part of the system is tested individually. Test scope is smaller; errors are easier to find. Detected earlier. Isolated.

Faster Debugging
- Unit testing examines small pieces of code, and makes error isolation easier

Faster Development
- Reducing the debugging time

Code Coverage
- Unit testing improves code coverage

Documentation
- Unit testing provides living documentation developers can refer to unit tests

```java
// java\<package>\Message.java
package com.example.demosb;

public class Message {
    public static String getMessage() {
        return "Hello there!!!";
    }
}
```

```java
// tests\<package>\MessageTests.java
package com.example.demo_sb;

import com.example.demosb.Message;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class MessageTests {
    @Test
    void testMessage() {
        String expected = "Hello there!!!";
        String actual = Message.getMessage();
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}
```

## Creating Unit Tests

1) Plan Unit Tests
    - Decompose program into units (discrete, testable parts) then write unit test for each one
    - State-based testing used to see if program unit produces expected result
    - Interaction-based testing focuses on how that result was achieved
    - Plan simple and readable tests, simple tests

2) Write Testable Code
    - plan/design - have code that can be unit tested: loosely coupled.

3) Using the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) Approach
    - Determine data needed
    - Arrange: set up the unit to be tested
    - Act: call unit to be tested
    - Assert: check actual outcome = expected
    - Analyse Test results

## Right BICEP

- Right: are the test results right?
- Boundary conditions
- Inverse relationships
- Cross check results
- Error conditions
- Performance characteristics in bounds (Does performance change as input size grows?)

## JUnit

- test class name - end with "Test".
- test method name - begin with "test"
- test return type - void (procedure â€“ no result)
- If test runs correctly, test method does nothing
- If test fails, throws an AssertionFailedError

- `@Test`: indicates public void method - can be executed as test case
- `@Test(timeout=500)`: indicates test fails if not complete within 500 milliseconds
- `@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)`: using "expected" parameter, specify exception name that test may throw to Pass.
- `@Before`, `@After`: used to execute common code before or after each test case (such as preconditions or resetting variables)
-` @BeforeClass`, ` @AfterClass`: used to execute expensive operation (such as database connection, server startup, releasing resources before or after all test cases)

## Unit Testing Guidelines

- Unit test 1 or multiple assertions (but for similar actions)
- If 1 (or more) assertions fails, the test exits & rest are not checked
- When bug is present in the system, 1 or 2 unit tests might fail which can make it easier to locate bug
- Under no circumstances should you continue to add features while tests are failing
- Fix any test as soon as it fails, & keep it passing while other features are being added (regression testing)

## Mock Objects

Unit testing tests units independently, so it is required to isolate units under test from resources or dependencies (e.g., databases).

Mock object = dummy implementation for class

Mock objects are placeholder objects that are:
- predictable
- allow you to replace chunks of complex functionality that are not the subject of the test

Use mock objects when real object:
- has non-deterministic behaviour
- is difficult to setup
- has behaviour hard to trigger (e.g., network error)
- is slow
- has (or is) a user interface
- does not yet exist
