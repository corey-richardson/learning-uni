# SQL: Structured Query Language

- Originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational databases
- A database computer language designed for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS)
- A declarative language, though now also includes procedural elements

SQL comprises of
1. DDL - Data Definition Language
2. DML - Data Manipulation Language
3. DCL - Data Control Language

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

A syntax for creating and modifying database objects such as tables, indices and users.

DDL statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in your database.

When executing DDL statements, it takes effect immediately.

### Components/Syntax of SQL

Case sensitivity only exists in literal character strings
- Oracle is case sensitive
- SQL Server is NOT case sensitive

### System Datatypes in SQL Server

Numeric
- `int` `bigint` `smallint` `tinyint`
- `numeric` `bit` `decimal` `money`
- `float` `real`

Date and time
- `date` `datetime` `time`

Character strings
- `char` `varchar`

Binary strings
- `binary` `image`

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

- `CREATE` creates an object (e.g. a table) in the database
- `ALTER` modifies the structure of an existing object in various ways - e.g. adding a column to an existing table
- `DROP` deletes an object in the database, usually irretrievably

### Schema

- Collection of database objects that are logically grouped together
    - e.g. tables, views, and procedures
- The dbo schema is the default schema of every database
- `CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;`

### `CREATE TABLE` syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE {database_name.schema_name.table_name | schema_name.table_name | table_name}
```

> Specifying a schema is optional <br>
> The dbo schema is the default schema of every database.

### `CREATE TABLE` Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE subject (
    Subject_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    Menu_item VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Position TINYINT,
    Visible BIT DEFAULT 1
);
```
```sql
IDENTITY(seed, increment)
```

### Sequence

A user defined object that generates a number sequence which can be attached to a table column while inserting 

Sequence is significantly faster than Identity

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
    START WITH <constant>
    INCREMENT BY <constant>;
```

### `ALTER TABLE`

```sql
ALTER TABLE subject
    ADD cost FLOAT(2);

ALTER TABLE subject
    ADD Subject_Date DATE;
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE <table name>
    ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint name> PRIMARY KEY
    (<attribute list>);
```

- Statement may be used to specify primary & foreign key constraints, as well as to make other modifications to the table structure
- Key constraints may also be specified in the `CREATE TABLE` statement – but need to include a constraint name.
- You should specify the constraint name (e.g. `con_customer_id`). The attribute list contains one or more attributes
- If more than one, the names are separated by commas

```sql
-- PRIMARY KEY
ALTER TABLE person
    ADD PRIMARY KEY (Customer_id);

-- BETTER AS:
ALTER TABLE person
    ADD CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY
    (Customer_id);

-- Multiple Columns:
ALTER TABLE person
    ADD CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY
    (Customer_id, Last_name);
```
```sql
-- FOREIGN KEY
-- specify both the foreign key attributes in the (child)
-- table & the primary key attributes they link to in the parent table
ALTER TABLE <table name>
    ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint name> FOREIGN
        KEY (<attribute list>)
            REFERENCES <parent table name>
                (<attribute list>);
```

### `DROP`

```sql
DROP TABLE <table name>;

ALTER TABLE <table_name>
    DROP COLUMN <column_name>;

ALTER TABLE <tablename>
    DROP CONSTRAINT <constraintname>;
```

The `DROP TABLE` statement won’t work unless you separately drop any foreign keys that refer to the table you want to drop.

***It also removes all data that was contained in the table.***

You can only drop the PRIMARY KEY by using the constraint name. Otherwise you would need to drop whole table and recreate it.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Operation | SQL | Desc.
--- | --- | ---
Create | `INSERT INTO` | Inserts new data
Read | `SELECT` | Extracts data
Update | `UPDATE` | Updates data
Delete | `DELETE` | Deletes data

```sql
-- Adds a new row to a table:
INSERT INTO <table name>
    VALUES (<value1>, ..., <value n>);
```

```sql
-- Change values that are already in a table:
UPDATE <tablename>
    SET <attribute> = <expression> WHERE <condition>;

-- If the WHERE clause is omitted, then the specified attribute is
-- set to the same value in every row of the table
```

```sql
-- Deletes records (rows) in a table:
DELETE FROM <table name> WHERE <condition>;
```

# `SELECT` Queries

# SQL : SELECT Queries

> The use of SQL statements to extract data from a database.

SQL structures data retrieval into 3 distinct clauses known collectively as a `SELECT` statement
- `SELECT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`

Using `DISTINCT` removes duplicates <br>
Using `ALL` retains them - but this is the default

A `WHERE` clause restricts the records that are returned

Types of condition
1. Comparison (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=, NOT, AND, OR)
2. Range (BETWEEN)
3. Set Membership (IN)
4. Pattern Match (LIKE)
5. Null

Aggregate Functions
- COUNT()
- SUM()
- MIN(), MAX()
- AVG()
- StDev() (Standard Deviation)
- VAR (Variance, $\text{StDev}^2$)

Grouping Data
- GROUP BY
- HAVING \<condition>
    - Used as a final filter
    - Filters the results after the `GROUP BY` function

Sorting Data
- ORDER BY \<column>
- ORDER BY \<column> DESC

### Joining Tables

In a relational DBMS, often a need to extract data from more than one table at a time

Tables can be joined where there are common column(s) usually a 'primary key - foreign key' relationship

`SELECT * FROM Table1, Table2;`

If the tables have columns with the same name then reference columns

`SELECT Table1.column, Table2.column FROM Table1, Table2;`
