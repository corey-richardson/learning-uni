# Database Design and Modelling

Presentation Layer > Business Logic Layer > Data Layer

Data: unprocessed information, facts that have not been organised

Information: processed data

Sorting, Searching, Filtering, Aggregating, Performing calculations

Useful Information: Relevant and applicable, Accurate, Up to date, Consistent, Accessible (with authorisation), Secure (integrity), Complete, Presented in a usable form

Database: collections of information existing over a period of time

*Create, Read, Update, Delete*

- E-R Modelling (Entity-Relationship) *or*
- Logical Data Structure/Model (LDM)
- Relational Data Analysis (Normalization)

For Many-to-Many relationships, you usually have to create a link entity.

`a >--< b` -> `a -< L >- b`

Optional relationships are denoted with dashed lines.

# Roundel Example

- Make a list of assumptions
- Draw initial ERD
- Resolve one-to-one relationships
- Resolve many-to-many relationships with link entities
- Remove redundant relationships
- Tidy up the diagram
- Check optionality
