## Monolithic Architecture

A single, unified codebase for the entire application. All components are interconnected and interdependent. Deployed as a single unit.

Advantages
- Simple development and deployment
- Easier testing

Disadvantages
- Scalability limitations
- Difficult to maintain and update
- Tight coupling of components

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Architectural style where functionalities are provided as services. Services communicate over a network and have Loose coupling/Reusability/Interoperability.

Advantages
- Improved scalability
- Reusable services
- Better maintainability

Disadvantages
- Complexity in management
- ESB can become a bottleneck, Enterprise Service Bus
- Overhead of service calls

Limitations of SOA:
- Monolithic ESB
- Complexity in service orchestration

Services are small, independently deployable units. Decentralised governance and data management. Compared to SOA, they offer Fine-grained services and No Centralised ESB.

## Transition to Microservices

An architectural style where applications are composed of small, independent services.

Each service runs in its own process. Services communicate over lightweight protocols like HTTP or REST. Continuous delivery and deployment.

Advantages
- High scalability and flexibility
- Independent development and deployment
- Fault isolation

Disadvantages
- Increased complexity in distributed systems
- Challenges in testing
- Potential for duplication

## Core Concepts of Microservices

Independent Deployment, Services can be updated without redeploying the entire application.

Autonomous Teams, Teams work on individual services.

Technology Diversity, Freedom to choose the best technology per service.

Business Capability Focused, Services aligned with business functions.

Service Independence
- Loose Coupling
- High Cohesion
- Data Isolation

Service Communication,
- Inter-Service Communication (Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication)
- APIs and Protocols (RESTful, gRPC, messaging queues)
- Dynamic Service Discovery

Scalability in Microservices
- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling out by adding more instances)

Load Balancing
- Distributing requests across instances

Auto-Scaling
- Dynamic scaling based on demand

Data Management in Microservices

- Database per Service (Encapsulation/Isolation of data)
- Data Consistency
- Distributed Transactions (Saga patterns and compensating transactions (*\*A saga is a sequence of local transactions.*))

### Service Deployment Strategies

- Containers and Orchestration (Docker and Kubernetes)
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, Automated bui;ds and deployment pipelines
- Blue-Green and Canary Deployments (Strategies for zero-downtime deployments)

### Blue-Green and Canary Deployments

Blue-Green and Canary deployments are both strategies for safely deploying new application versions in a way that minimizes downtime and reduces risk.

Blue-Green Deployment
- Two identical environments, called "Blue" and "Green," are used to manage production environments.
- One of the environments (let's say Blue) is live and handling the current production traffic, while the other (Green) is idle or in a staging state.
- The new version of the application is deployed to the idle environment (Green) without affecting the live production environment.
- Once testing and validation are complete, traffic is rerouted from the Blue environment to the Green environment, making Green the new production environment.
- If issues are detected, it's straightforward to revert traffic back to Blue, minimizing downtime.
- Minimal downtime, as the switch is nearly instantaneous, Simple rollback if problems arise.
- Requires double the infrastructure, as two environments must be maintained.

Canary Deployment
- In a Canary deployment, the new version of the application is gradually released to a small portion of users.
- A small subset of production users is directed to the new version (Canary) while the rest continue to use the previous version.
- As the new version proves to be stable with the subset, the rollout continues to larger portions of the user base.
- Continuous monitoring allows developers to identify any issues with the new version.
- If an issue is detected at any point, the new version is rolled back to avoid impacting the broader user base.
- Reduces risk by limiting initial exposure to the new version, Issues can be caught early in the deployment process.
- Requires sophisticated monitoring to detect issues at each stage, More complex to implement than Blue-Green deployments.

Blue-Green works best for applications where quick rollback is essential and where the application infrastructure can support two environments.

Canary is suitable for applications where gradual testing with real users is necessary and for systems that can support staged rollouts.

### Fault Tolerance and Resilience

- Circuit Breakers prevent cascading failures
- Fallback Mechanisms handle default responses or alternative services
- Bulkheads isolate components to prevent failures from spreading

### Monitoring and Logging

- Centralised Logging collects logs from all services
- Distributed Tracing tracks requests across services
- Metrics and Alerts provide real-time monitoring of service health

### Security in Microservices

- Authentication and Authorisation (OAuth2, JWT Tokens)
- API Gateways are centralised points for enforcing security policies
- Service Mesh, Secure service-to-service communication

### API Gateway Pattern

- Role of API Gateways, request routing, composition and protocol translation
- Simplifies client interactions, enhanced security and monitoring
- Potential bottleneck, added complexity.

### Event-Driven Microservices

- Asynchronous Communication, decouples services via events
- Message Brokers, Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS
- Message brokers are tools that help in the asynchronous transfer of data between different services or applications by acting as intermediaries.
- They help ensure that messages (data packets) sent by one service can be received by another, even if the two services are not online or synchronized at the same time. This decoupling of services increases scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility.
- Event Sourcing and CQRS, Capturing changes as a sequence of events.
- Event Sourcing is a way of persisting the state of an application by storing a series of events that describe state changes rather than storing the current state itself.
- Every state change in the application is captured as an event. These events are stored in an event store (often a specialized database) and are immutable, meaning they can only be appended and never altered.
- To reconstruct the current state of an entity, the application replays all events for that entity from the beginning to the present. This replay process allows the system to derive the current state.
- Auditability: Since every state change is recorded, it’s easy to see the history of changes.
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates the responsibility of handling commands (writes) and queries (reads).
- Command Side: Responsible for handling commands that modify the state (e.g., create, update, delete operations). Commands lead to events in Event Sourcing.
- Query Side: Optimized for reading data, often using a separate read model that’s optimized for quick queries and sometimes even a separate database.

### Testing Microservices

- Unit Testing, individual services
- Integration Testing, interactions between services
- Contract Testing, service interfaces meet expectations

## Organizational Impact

- DevOps Culture. Collaboration between development and operations.
- Team Autonomy, Empowered teams responsible for services.
- Challenges, Managing cross-team communication, Ensuring consistency and standards.

### Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

- Service Overload, too many tiny services.
- Shared Databases, violates data encapsulation.
- Neglecting Automation, manual processes hinder agility.

### Best Practices for Microservices

- Design for Failure, Implement resilience patterns.
- Embrace Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Align services with business domains.
- DDD aims to ensure that the software design closely mirrors the business structure, facilitating better collaboration, clarity, and system agility.
- Continuous Learning and Improvement, Iterate and adapt practices.

## How APIs Work

Application Programming Interface

Enables communication between software components.

An API as an Abstraction Layer, hiding complexity and exposing functionalities.

- Web APIs, accessible over the internet
- Library/Framework APIs, used within programming environments
- Operating System APIs, interacting with OS functionalities
- Database APIs, communication with database systems

### Web APIs and RESTful Architecture

REST: Representational State Transfer

RESTful APIs: Stateless, client-server communication

### Client-Server Model

Client handles user interface; server handles data.

Communication over HTTP/S.

### Requests and Responses

HTTP
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Request Structure
- Endpoint URL, headers, body

Response Structure
- Status Code, headers, body

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), lightweight human-readable format

XML (eXtensible Markup Language), structured data with tags

### Building and Consuming APIs

Design First Approach, Planning before implementation.

API Development Best Practices, Consistency, error handling, and naming conventions.

Consuming APIs, Using SDKs, HTTP clients, and testing.
