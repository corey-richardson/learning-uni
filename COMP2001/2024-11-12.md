## Microservice Boundaries

Deciding on good boundaries, modular decomposition, when creating systems makes them easier to understand, maintain and scale.

### Information Hiding

Emphasises encapsulation. Each module should hide it's internal details such as data structures, implementation logic and algorithms from other parts of the system.

By doing this, it reduces the complexity of the system by allowing modules to interact *only* through clearly defined interfaces, like APIs. This makes it easier to update or replace parts of the system without breaking others as the other services are independent to the implementation of the service, only the result.

Each microservice should act like a black box. Other services only need to know what it does, not how it does it.

For example, a "User Profile" microservice might expose an API like `GET /user/{id}`, but its internal database schema, query logic, or caching mechanisms are hidden from other services.

### Cohesion

Cohesion refers to the strength of the relationships within a module - how well its parts work together to achieve a single, focused purpose.

High cohesion makes a module:
- Easier to understand, clear purpose
- More robust, all related functionality is grouped together
- Simpler to maintain, changes are localised

Related functionality should be grouped within the same module. For example, all user authentication tasks would belong in a single service.

Mixing of unrelated functionality should be avoided. If a module handles both "User Profiles" and "Payment Processing" it is probably poorly cohesive.

If the code in a module frequently changes together, it's a sign it belongs together.

### Coupling

Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between different modules; how much they rely on each other to function.

Aim for *Loose Coupling* as:
- Changes in one module are less likely to affect each other
- Modules can evolve independently
- Modules can be reused or replaced easier in different contexts

Minimise the number of shared data structures or APIs between modules. Use clearly defined contracts for communication. Avoid "spaghetti code" interdependencies, where modules call each other in unstructured ways.

Coupling is unavoidable, but reduce it as much as possible.

> Cohesion is about *internal* relationships; coupling is about *external* ones.

### Domain Coupling

Domain coupling occurs when one microservice needs to interact with another to fulfill its responsibilities.

In most real-world applications, microservices need to collaborate to complete tasks. No service can operate in complete isolation if it's part of a larger system. ***Coupling is unavoidable.***

One service does too much if a service contains business logic that spans multiple domains. For example, an Order Processing service might also handle user authentication, which it shouldn't.

A tightly coupled domain structure can lead to cascading failures. If one service goes down, the dependent services may fail too.

Ensure that each microservice follows the *Single Responsibility Principle*: it should only deal with the logic specific to its domain.

Use event-driven architectures where possible, so services communicate via events rather than direct calls.

### Pass-Through Coupling

Pass-through coupling occurs when a microservice acts as a "middleman," passing data between services without processing it meaningfully. For example, Service A receives a request, forwards it to Service B, and then Service B sends it to Service C.

Changes to the data format or requirements downstream (e.g., Service C) might require significant updates upstream (Service A and B). This increases the maintenance burden and introduces fragility.

The intermediary service adds latency and complexity without adding much value.

Eliminate the middleman where possible by allowing services to communicate directly. For instance, let Service A call Service C directly instead of going through Service B.

Use API Gateways to handle forwarding or routing logic for external-facing systems, reducing the need for pass-through behavior within the microservice architecture.

### Common Coupling

This occurs when multiple microservices share a common resource, such as a shared database or global state. For example, if both the Order Processing and Inventory Management services directly access the same product database.


Changes to the structure or schema of the database (e.g., adding a column, renaming fields) can impact all the services using it.

Without proper safeguards, one service might modify the data in ways that break the logic of another service.

A single shared database becomes a bottleneck as the system grows, limiting the independent scalability of microservices.

Reject invalid requests where needed. Validate inputs before passing them to the database to ensure consistency and avoid corrupting shared data.

Use a Database-per-Service model. Each microservice owns and manages its own database. For cross-service data access, use APIs or an event-driven system to share relevant data.

If a shared database is unavoidable (e.g., for legacy systems), use strict data governance policies and schemas to minimize accidental conflicts.

### Design Philosophy 

- Minimise dependencies where possible: Strive for loose coupling by designing services to interact through well-defined APIs or asynchronous messages.
- Encourage autonomy: Each microservice should own its domain, data, and logic.
- Contain impact: Anticipate changes and design your architecture to limit how far-reaching those changes can be.

### Resource Contention

Resource contention occurs when multiple microservices simultaneously access a shared resource (like a database or file system), leading to performance bottlenecks or resource unavailability.

When too many services query the same database at once, the database server can become overwhelmed, resulting in slower response times or downtime.

Resource slowness impacts all dependent services, potentially causing cascading failures across the system. For example, a slow database impacts both the user-facing API and backend services that rely on it.

Expensive, complex or unoptimized SQL queries consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O), worsening contention. Running a full table scan instead of an indexed query can lock rows or cause transaction delays. Rewrite and optimize SQL queries to ensure they are efficient. Use indexes, partitioning, and database profiling to identify and fix slow queries. `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`

Give each microservice its own database. This avoids contention but requires carefully designed mechanisms for data synchronization. Inventory Management has its own inventory database; Order Processing only interacts with it via APIs or event streams.

Use caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce direct database reads for frequently requested data. Frequently accessed product details are cached so that the Product Catalog database isn't constantly hit.

Rate Limiting and Throttling: Limit the number of requests each service can make to shared resources to prevent overload.

### Content Coupling

Content coupling occurs when one microservice directly accesses and modifies the internal state of another microservice, violating separation of concerns and ownership boundaries.

Blurring Ownership Lines. When one service manipulates another's internal state directly, the boundary between the two services becomes unclear. For example, when an Order Processing service directly modifies the inventory count in the Inventory Management service's database, bypassing its business logic. Only interact with a service through its public API; avoid directly accessing its database or internal structures. Use the Inventory Management API to update stock instead of directly modifying the database. 

Logic from the downstream service may be copied into the upstream service, leading to inconsistencies. Different logic or out-of-sync modifications can result in wrong data or system crashes. Each service should own and manage its domain logic and data. Other services should rely on it for accurate data.

Use an event bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to share state changes across services asynchronously. When the Order Processing service places an order, it emits an event like `OrderPlaced`. The Inventory Management service listens to this event to update stock levels.

Define clear contracts (e.g., REST API schemas, gRPC definitions) for how services interact, ensuring changes in one service don't ripple unexpectedly.

Resource contention and content coupling are common pitfalls in microservice architectures, but careful design and discipline can minimize their impact. Both issues highlight the importance of service autonomy - each service should be self-contained and interact with others in a controlled, well-defined manner.

## Domain-Driven Design, DDD

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a methodology for structuring complex software systems by closely aligning them with the business domain they represent. It's especially valuable in microservice architectures to identify clear, logical boundaries between services.

### Ubiquitous Language

Use the same terms in our code as the users use.

Ubiquitous Language is a shared vocabulary that is used consistently by everyone involved—developers, domain experts, stakeholders—to describe the business domain and system.

The language is reflected in the code, documentation, and even day-to-day discussions.

Promotes clarity and understanding across the team. Reduces miscommunication between developers and domain experts. Keeps code readable and aligned with business logic.

Use these terms in your class names, variables, and APIs. Avoid generic names like `data`, `info`, or `item` that don't convey the domain's intent.

### Aggregate

An aggregate is a cluster of objects treated as a single unit to ensure consistency within a specific boundary. Aggregates model real-world concepts and define how data is grouped and manipulated together.

Prevents inconsistencies by ensuring that operations on related data are grouped together. Simplifies business logic by encapsulating related functionality in one place.

Identify entities that naturally belong together in the business domain. Define a root entity (the primary entry point) and keep other entities tightly scoped within the aggregate.

Self-contained units: code that handles the state transitions of an aggregate are grouped together, along with the state itself. If an outside service requests a state transition in an aggregate, the aggregate can say no.

### Bounded Context

A bounded context defines an explicit boundary within a business domain.

Inside this boundary:
- The domain model is coherent and specific to that context.
- Business rules and terms may differ from those in other contexts.

Each bounded context can correspond to a microservice.

Keeps domain complexity manageable by breaking it into focused, self-contained sections. Avoids conflicts when different parts of the system interpret terms differently. Makes integration between contexts explicit and controlled.

Identify distinct parts of the business domain where terms, rules, or priorities vary. Define clear APIs or integration mechanisms between bounded contexts.

### DDD and Microservice Design

DDD helps identify natural boundaries for microservices by dividing the system into manageable, domain-aligned chunks.

The shared language ensures that all microservices follow consistent terminology.

Aggregates help define what data a microservice owns and manages.

Each bounded context can become its own microservice.

- Boundaries are drawn based on business logic rather than arbitrary technical constraints.
- Clear separation of concerns between services ensures loose coupling.
- Ubiquitous Language aligns technical and non-technical stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.
- Bounded contexts localize changes to specific services.

Imagine building a ride-hailing app:

Bounded Contexts
- Driver Management (e.g., driver profiles, vehicle data).
- Trip Management (e.g., booking, routes, and pricing).
- Payment Processing (e.g., fare calculation, transactions).

Ubiquitous Language
- Use clear terms like "Driver", "Trip", and "Fare" consistently across teams and code.

Aggregates
- The Trip aggregate may include a trip ID, start and end locations, the driver assigned, and the fare.

Both aggregates and bounded contexts work well as service boundaries. To start with, identify a number of coarse-grained bounded contexts.

## Alternatives to Domain Boundaries

Alternatives like using *volatility*, *data concerns*, *technology*, and *organisational structure* provide additional perspectives for identifying effective boundaries.

### Volatility-Based Boundaries

Volatility focuses on how often certain parts of the system change. Services are grouped based on stability and the frequency of updates. The idea is to isolate highly volatile components so that changes don't cascade across the system.

Features or components that undergo frequent updates, such as business logic responding to market trends, should be in their own service to reduce ripple effects. In an e-commerce platform, a Pricing Service may change frequently due to sales, discounts, or regional pricing strategies.

Stable components like authentication or payment gateways can be in separate services because they rarely change and are critical for system reliability.

This minimises the risk of introducing bugs into stable parts of the system when updating volatile components. Reduces the need for frequent redeployment of unrelated services.

### Data-Centric Boundaries

These boundaries prioritise the handling of data ownership, privacy, and security concerns, often driven by regulations like GDPR.

Services should own only the data they need to fulfill their responsibilities. Overlap or excessive sharing increases security risks.

A Customer Service owns sensitive customer data (e.g., addresses, payment details), while a Marketing Service has access to anonymized analytics.

Microservices should be designed to make data deletions or updates easy and traceable to comply with *right-to-be-forgotten* laws. A User Profile Service manages all personal data, and downstream services only receive anonymized or tokenized data.

Simplifies compliance with data protection regulations. Reduces exposure during data breaches by limiting what each service can access.

### Technology-Centric Boundaries

These boundaries focus on the underlying technology stack or implementation details of different components.

When using Diverse Technology Stacks, services could be split based on the technology best suited to their task. A Machine Learning Service might use Python (TensorFlow), while a Real-Time Notification Service uses Node.js for event-driven architecture.

Independent Scalability. Services built on technology designed for specific workloads can scale independently. A Search Service powered by Elasticsearch can scale for read-heavy operations, while a Transaction Service using PostgreSQL focuses on ACID compliance.

For systems with legacy components, technology-based boundaries can isolate older systems, allowing modernisation without disrupting the whole.

### Organisational Boundaries

Organisational boundaries align services with team structures and ownership. The goal is to ensure clear accountability and efficient collaboration.

A service spanning multiple teams often leads to unclear ownership, delays, and friction. If both the Marketing and Sales teams depend on the same Lead Management Service, disputes may arise over priorities or changes.

Microservice designs should be flexible enough to handle reorganisations or team changes. If a company switches from regional teams to product-based teams, service ownership may need realignment.

*Conway's Law: "Organisations design systems that mirror their communication structures."*

Aligning services with teams improves ownership and accountability and reduces the risk of dependencies and delays caused by cross-team coordination.

For high-compliance industries (e.g., healthcare, finance):
- Prioritise Data boundaries to handle security and privacy.

For highly dynamic businesses (e.g., e-commerce, startups):
- Use Volatility to isolate frequently changing parts of the system.

For diverse technology needs (e.g., AI-driven systems):
- Opt for Technology boundaries to maximize flexibility and performance.

For large teams or enterprises:
- Favour Organizational boundaries to align with team structures and avoid bottlenecks.

Combining these approaches often works best.
- Use DDD to establish the domain boundaries (e.g., "Orders" or "Inventory").
- Adjust based on volatility to isolate frequently changing logic (e.g., pricing logic).
- Apply data concerns to ensure security (e.g., separating sensitive payment details).
- Align boundaries with organisational teams to maintain clear accountability.
