Accreditation confirms that your degree equips you with not just technical skills, but also the ethical and professional awareness to succeed in a global industry.

## Understanding Ethics and Their Role in IT

### What Are Ethics?

Ethics can be broadly defined as a framework guiding human behaviour and decision-making:

Principles of Right Conduct
- A set of guidelines that distinguish right from wrong actions.

Moral Systems
- Theories or systems of values that help individuals and societies navigate moral questions.

Moral Philosophy
- The study of morals, their nature, and the rationale behind specific moral choices.

Professional Standards
- The rules or standards that govern conduct within a particular field, such as IT.

### The Responsibility of IT Professionals

Impact Awareness
- Recognising how software or services affect individuals and communities, both positively and negatively.

Security Vigilance

To analyse and resolve ethical dilemmas, follow these structured steps:

1. Identify and Describe the Facts:
    - Determine what the IT system does and how it is being used.
2. Define the Conflict or Dilemma:
    - Identify the higher-order values at stake (e.g., privacy, intellectual property, fairness).
3. Identify the Stakeholders:
    - Determine who is affected by the technology, directly or indirectly.
4. Explore Options:
    - List possible courses of action and aim to find an optimal balance among conflicting values.
5. Weigh Potential Consequences:
    - Evaluate the outcomes of each option for all stakeholders and select the most ethical approach.

By considering these aspects, you can approach your coursework—and future professional work—with a strong ethical foundation.

## Privacy

### Defining Privacy

> Privacy is the "claim of individuals to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.", Alan F. Westin

This definition emphasises autonomy over personal information, granting individuals control over its use and dissemination.

> "You have zero privacy \[on the Internet] anyway. Get over it.", Scott McNealy

This view highlights the challenges posed by the IT sector, where privacy is often treated as secondary to innovation, convenience, or profit.

### Privacy and the Evolution of Technology

Privacy is not a new concept, but its prominence has grown as technology has advanced.

The increasing ability to collect, store, and share vast amounts of personal data has necessitated laws and ethical guidelines to protect individuals’ rights.

Examples of these legal responses include GDPR, the Data Protection Act, and Privacy Shield frameworks.

### How Do You Respect Individuals Desires for Privacy?

- Transparency: Clearly communicate how their data is used.
- Consent: Always obtain explicit consent before collecting or sharing personal information.
- Security: Protect personal data against unauthorised access or breaches.

## Privacy Online

### Who Is Responsible?

Government
- Enacts laws and regulations to protect privacy rights (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Monitors compliance and penalises breaches.

Companies
- Implement policies and technologies to safeguard user data.
- Ensure transparency about data collection and usage.

Professionals
- Act ethically, ensuring that privacy principles guide design and development.
- Recognise and mitigate potential privacy risks in their work.

Individuals
- Take responsibility for their digital footprint (e.g., understanding terms of service, using privacy tools).
- Exercise caution when sharing personal information online.

### Challenges

- Ubiquitous surveillance (e.g., social media, IoT devices).
- The trade-off between convenience and control over personal data.
- Ambiguous accountability in cases of data misuse.

### Solutions

- Stronger privacy-by-design approaches in IT systems.
- Enhanced privacy education and awareness for individuals.
- International cooperation to standardise and enforce privacy laws.

## Protecting Personal Information

### What Is Personal Information?

Personal information refers to any data that can identify an individual, such as:
- Name, address, email, phone number.
- Financial details like credit card numbers.
- Online identifiers (e.g., IP addresses, cookies).
- Sensitive data, such as health records or biometric information.

> Personally Identifiable Information, PII

### Why Protect Personal Information?

Trust is foundational in online interactions. Without trust, users hesitate to share data, which can lead to reduced engagement, sales, or adoption of services.

Compliance with laws like GDPR or CCPA mandates data protection. Breaches can lead to penalties and reputational damage.

## Privacy Models in IT and Software Design

### Privacy Interface Analysis

This model focuses on the user experience and ensures transparency and control over personal data

User Understanding
- How easily can users comprehend what is happening to their data?
- Are privacy policies, permissions, and settings presented in clear, user-friendly language?

Application Interactions
- How does your application interact with other software or systems?
- For example, does it share user data with external services or integrate with third-party tools?

Third-Party Privacy Policies
- What are the data handling practices of third-party services integrated with your application?
- Ensure alignment with your own privacy standards and communicate this to users.

### Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

A systematic process to evaluate how personal data flows through your application and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

Data Flow Understanding
- Identify where personal data is collected, stored, processed, and shared.
- Assess the risks at each stage of data handling.

Clear Documentation
- Create a transparent method for describing how data is managed.
- Use tools like data flow diagrams or data mapping to visualise the lifecycle of personal data.

### Privacy in Software Development

Privacy Deployment Guide
- Develop a comprehensive guide detailing how your software implements privacy measures.
- Include instructions for configuring privacy settings, managing data sharing, and applying security updates.

Enterprise-Level Privacy Management:
- IT Administrators Needs
    - Provide detailed information about what parts of your software communicate outside the enterprise (e.g., telemetry, - updates, or cloud services).
- Group Policy Management
    - Large systems like Microsoft Windows allow organisations to use tools such as Group Policies to configure privacy settings centrally.
    - This approach saves time and ensures consistent privacy settings across all devices.

## Security and Privacy

Organisations are legally and ethically responsible for protecting the personal data they collect.

In the event of a data breach, businesses face potential lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage. Laws like GDPR and CCPA enforce strict penalties for failures in data protection.

Ensuring only authorised individuals with a legitimate “need to know” can access sensitive information.

The seriousness of disclosure depends on the recipient.
- Internal Breach: Sharing data with unauthorised personnel within the organisation may pose less risk.
- External Breach: Disclosure to outsiders (e.g., hackers, competitors) is far more serious and damaging.

Privacy involves protecting individuals' personal information and autonomy. Security ensures that data, systems, and physical spaces are protected from harm or misuse. There’s an ongoing debate about how much privacy individuals should sacrifice to achieve security.

Governments monitoring internet communications to detect and prevent terrorist activity. While this enhances security, it intrudes on individuals' privacy by potentially surveilling innocent citizens.

Police states may reduce certain crimes through surveillance but fail to provide a fundamentally secure environment.

Implement privacy-by-design to ensure that security measures enhance, rather than compromise, privacy. Use encryption and access control to protect data while respecting user autonomy.

Clearly communicate to users how their data is secured and for what purpose. Give users control over their data wherever possible.

Regularly review policies and practices to ensure a balance between security and privacy. Involve stakeholders, including users, in discussions about acceptable trade-offs.

## Professional bodies

Professional bodies play a crucial role in maintaining standards and regulating the conduct of their members.
- Codes of Conduct: Clear ethical guidelines to ensure professionalism and accountability.
- Standardisation: Establishing consistent practices across industries.
