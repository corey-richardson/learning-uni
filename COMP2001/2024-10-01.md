Relational Data Analysis

Relational Data Analysis (RDA) is a technique for deriving data structures based on the mathematics of set theory.

The process is underpinned by Relational Algebra.

Structures real world data into groups

Ensures efficiency of file organisation

Removes redundant (duplicate) data

7 forms (we go upto 3NF)

Identify entity types with their attributes

One or more attributes will act as a *key*, unique identifier

Non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the key/s

**Key types**
- Primary
    - best choice of all candidate keys for a relation
- Foreign
    - primary key of one relation and a non-key attrubute of another
- Simple
    - a single attribute
- Compound
    - two or more independent attributes
- Composite
    - at least one independent attribute plus a dependent attribute

A relation is a 2D array with a unique primary key

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, hash TEXT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id));
-- `id` is the primary key

CREATE TABLE courses (id INTEGER, user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, url TEXT, topics TEXT NOT NULL, desc TEXT NOT NULL, provider TEXT NOT NULL, is_complete BOOL NOT NULL, is_course BOOL NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id)); 
-- `user_id` is a foreign key into `TABLE users`
```
