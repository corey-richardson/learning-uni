Relational Data Analysis

Relational Data Analysis (RDA) is a technique for deriving data structures based on the mathematics of set theory.

The process is underpinned by Relational Algebra.

Structures real world data into groups

Ensures efficiency of file organisation

Removes redundant (duplicate) data

7 forms (we go upto 3NF)

Identify entity types with their attributes

One or more attributes will act as a *key*, unique identifier

Non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the key/s

**Key types**
- Primary
    - best choice of all candidate keys for a relation
- Foreign
    - primary key of one relation and a non-key attrubute of another
- Simple
    - a single attribute
- Compound
    - two or more independent attributes
- Composite
    - at least one independent attribute plus a dependent attribute

A relation is a 2D array with a unique primary key

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, hash TEXT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id));
-- `id` is the primary key

CREATE TABLE courses (id INTEGER, user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, url TEXT, topics TEXT NOT NULL, desc TEXT NOT NULL, provider TEXT NOT NULL, is_complete BOOL NOT NULL, is_course BOOL NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(id)); 
-- `user_id` is a foreign key into `TABLE users`
```

## First Normal Form

- Seperate out multivalues attributes
- Choose a primary key for the new relation
- Copy the key of the originating relation as the first part of what will now be either a compound or composite key
- Any remaining attributes in the unnormalised column copied across using the initial key as the primary key of this relation

## Second Normal Form

- Seperate attributes which are dependent on only part of a key (part-key dependencies)
- New relation will contain the part of the key from the original relation and the dependent attributes
- Part-key is also retained in the original relation
- Any simple keys are already 2NF so are just copied over

## Third Normal Form

- Seperate out attributes which are dependent on non-key attributes; transistive dependencies
- Key and non-key attributes are treated as distinct groups within each relation

Relations in 3NF are Data Entities

RDA gives no information regarding optionality or relationship link phrases; these should be retained or added

Normalisation alone is unlikely to produce a good data model but  does identify many problems and clarifies the attributes

By 3NF all relationships between entities (relations) are one-to-many

A set of 3NF relations can be expressed as a partial LDS or Entity Model
