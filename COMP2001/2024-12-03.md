## Authentication vs. Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the user or system that is attempting to access a service or resource. Ensure that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be.

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system, once authenticated, has the right to access or perform a specific action on a resource. Determine the level of access granted to the authenticated entity. Ensures that users can only perform actions or access data that their role or permissions allow.

Authentication must always occur before authorization. You cannot decide what a user can do until you confirm who they are.

## The OAuth2 Protocol

### Understanding OAuth2

OAuth2 is an open standard protocol for authorization that provides secure, token-based access to resources without the need to share credentials directly. This protocol addresses key security concerns, especially around identity management and data access.

### The Risk of Security Leaks

With traditional username and password systems:
- The more places an identity is stored, the more opportunities there are for security leaks.
- Every service, application, or device storing a password is a potential attack surface.
- The more routes a password travels through (e.g., across different networks or devices), the higher the risk of interception.
- Attackers can create phishing websites that mimic legitimate services, tricking users into entering their credentials.
- OAuth2 reduces these risks by eliminating the need to share credentials directly with multiple services, using a more secure token-based authentication system.

### OAuth2 Grants

OAuth2 defines several types of authorization grants (methods for obtaining access tokens) to cater to different use cases.

Authorization Code Grant
- Used primarily for web applications.
- The user logs in through a service provider (e.g., Google, Facebook), which then redirects them back to the application with an authorization code.
- This code is exchanged for an access token that allows access to user data.
- Use case: Typically used for user authentication on web apps (e.g., logging into a third-party service using Google).

Client Credentials Grant
- Used for machine-to-machine communication, where the application itself needs access to resources, rather than an end-user.
- The client application authenticates itself with the authorization server using its own credentials (no user interaction).
- The application then receives an access token that can be used to access resources on behalf of the client itself, not a user.
- Use case: Used for services that need access to an API without involving a user (e.g., an application accessing a backend service).

### Benefits of OAuth2

With OAuth2, only one service (the authorization server) is aware of the user's password or multi-factor authentication (MFA) credentials. The services accessing resources (e.g., a third-party app) do not store or even need access to the user's password. Instead, they use access tokens which are more secure.

Instead of passing sensitive credentials around, OAuth2 uses access tokens (short-lived credentials) to grant access to specific resources, reducing the exposure of user credentials.

Since users do not enter their passwords into third-party applications, there is less chance for phishing attacks. Instead, the user authenticates with a trusted identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook) directly.

OAuth2 can integrate seamlessly with multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, further securing the process by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access tokens.

### Client Credentials Grant (CCG)

The application never has to deal with the username and the password. Only needs to learn how to identify the client.

A service can connect to the authentication microservice and ask for a token.

- Secures microservice interactions independently from the users
- Simplifies permission management by issuing tokens with different scopes depending on the context

## Token-Based Authentication

Token-based authentication is a modern and secure way of handling user authentication and authorization. It allows for the exchange of tokens (secure, encoded strings) to authenticate and authorize users or services, without requiring credentials (like passwords) to be passed around or stored by every service.

### Features of Token-Based Authentication

Authentication services can issue multiple tokens depending on the scope of access required. Each token can grant different sets of permissions, ensuring that users or services only access what they are authorised to. For example, one token might allow access to user profile data, while another might grant permission to update settings or access sensitive information.

Tokens can hold various pieces of information that help in both authentication and authorization.
- Username: The identity of the user or system making the request. This helps the service to identify who is requesting access.
- Scope: Defines the permissions or actions that the token allows. This limits what the user or system can do with the token (e.g., read-only access, admin privileges).
- Timestamp: The time at which the token was issued. This is useful for tracking token validity and usage.
- Expiration Timestamp: Specifies when the token will expire, ensuring that access is granted for a limited period. After expiration, the token becomes invalid, requiring re-authentication or renewal.

### Advantages of Token-Based Authentication


Stateless Authentication
- Tokens are self-contained and carry all necessary information for authentication and authorization. This allows services to operate in a stateless manner, without needing to store session data on the server.

Granular Control Over Permissions
- Since tokens can carry scope information, it's easy to grant specific permissions for different resources or actions, enhancing security and limiting unnecessary access.

Security
- Tokens can be signed and encrypted, which makes them resistant to tampering or impersonation.
- Using tokens ensures that credentials are never passed through the network, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks or phishing.

Scalability and Flexibility
- Token-based authentication is easily scalable, as tokens can be used across multiple services, APIs, and systems without the need for additional user authentication each time.
- Tokens can also be tailored for specific environments (e.g., single-page applications, mobile apps, and microservices), allowing seamless integration.

### How Token-Based Authentication Works

User Login
- The user enters their credentials (username/password) into the application.

Token Generation
- Upon successful authentication, the authentication service generates an access token (and possibly a refresh token) and sends it back to the application.

Accessing Resources
- The application sends the token to the resource server (API or service) when making requests. The server can decode the token and verify the user's identity, check their permissions (scope), and validate the expiration timestamp.

Expiration and Renewal
- When the token expires, the user must re-authenticate or use a refresh token (if provided) to obtain a new access token.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Standard

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a widely used standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is often used in conjunction with OAuth2 for authorization, enabling secure token-based authentication in distributed systems.

A JWT is a compact, URL-safe string composed of three parts, each separated by a dot (`.`).

The header contains information about how the token is signed (the signing algorithm) and the type of token.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

The payload contains the actual claimsâ€”the data that is being transmitted. Claims represent statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.


Claims are divided into three categories.
- Registered claims: Predefined claims that are recommended but not mandatory, such as `iat` (issued at), `exp` (expiration), `sub` (subject), etc.
- Public claims: Can be defined freely by those using JWT, but they should be collision-resistant.
- Private claims: Custom claims created to share information between parties (e.g., `user_id`, `roles`, `permissions`).

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is, and to ensure that the message wasn't altered along the way.

The signature is created by combining the encoded header and payload, then signing it using a secret key or a private key (depending on the signing algorithm).

```scss
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

A typical JWT might look like this (after being Base64 encoded):

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

1. Header (Base64Url encoded)
2. Payload (Base64Url encoded)
3. Signature (Base64Url encoded)

### Using JWT in OAuth2

OAuth2 uses JWT as a way to encode access tokens. When a user logs in and authorizes an application, the authorization server returns a JWT as the access token.

The application or service can then decode the token to verify its authenticity and access the information (e.g., user data, permissions) contained in the payload.

JWTs are used because they are compact, easy to transmit, and secure, providing an efficient way to handle authentication across systems.

### How to Decode a JWT

[JWT.io](JWT.io) is a popular online tool for decoding JWTs. It allows you to paste a JWT and view its header, payload, and signature, making it easy to inspect the tokenâ€™s contents and understand its structure.

## PyJWT

PyJWT is a Python library that provides the tools necessary to encode, decode, and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

PyJWT allows you to generate JWTs by encoding data (such as user claims) into a token, which can then be sent to clients or services for authentication.

PyJWT can decode JWTs to extract the payload and validate the token's signature. It also ensures that the token hasnâ€™t been tampered with.

PyJWT supports verifying JWTs to ensure that the token was issued by a trusted party, by checking the signature using a secret key or a public key.

```bash
pip install pyjwt
```

### Generating a JWT

```py
import jwt
import datetime

# Define the payload (the data to be included in the token)
payload = {
    "sub": "1234567890",  # User identifier
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iat": datetime.datetime.utcnow(),  # Issued at time
    "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)  # Expiration time
}

# Define a secret key for signing the token
secret_key = "my_secret_key"

# Encode the payload to create the JWT
token = jwt.encode(payload, secret_key, algorithm="HS256")

print("Generated JWT:", token)
```

### Decoding a JWT

```py
import jwt

# Define the JWT and secret key
encoded_token = "your_jwt_token_here"
secret_key = "my_secret_key"

try:
    # Decode the JWT
    decoded_payload = jwt.decode(encoded_token, secret_key, algorithms=["HS256"])
    print("Decoded Payload:", decoded_payload)
except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    print("Token has expired")
except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
    print("Invalid token")
```

### Verifying a JWT

```py
decoded_token = jwt.decode(encoded_token, secret_key, algorithms=["HS256"])
```

### Example of JWT with Expiration and Claims

```py
import jwt
import datetime

payload = {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "roles": ["admin", "editor"],
    "iat": datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
    "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=2)
}

secret_key = "my_secret_key"

token = jwt.encode(payload, secret_key, algorithm="HS256")

print("JWT with Expiration and Claims:", token)
```

## Securing your Code

Securing your code is an essential part of building reliable and secure software. Anything that is published to the web, such as web applications, APIs, or other online services, can potentially be attacked. Ensuring that your code is secure can help protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and reduce vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.

Sanitizing Input Data
- Concentrate on what we know about what our data should look like, instead of what it should not

Using Bandit linter
- Scan your source code for potential security risks
- Managed by the Python Code Quality Authority - GitHub

Dependencies
- Update our software quickly based on vulnerability in dependencies
- Dependabot, PyUP

### Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit organization focused on improving the security of software. It provides valuable resources for developers, such as security best practices, guidelines, and frameworks for building secure web applications.

OWASP is widely regarded as an authority in application security, and its OWASP Top Ten is a key resource for developers to identify and mitigate the most critical security risks in web applications.


### OWASP Top Ten

The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the most critical web application security risks, providing guidance on how to address and mitigate common vulnerabilities.

Injection Attacks
- Attackers can inject malicious code (such as SQL, OS commands, or LDAP queries) into an application, causing unintended behaviour. Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to mitigate injection attacks.

Broken Authentication
- Weak or broken authentication systems can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. Use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and avoid default credentials.

Sensitive Data Exposure
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data (such as passwords, credit card information, etc.) without encryption or other protection makes it vulnerable to theft. Ensure data is properly encrypted both at rest and in transit.

XML External Entities (XXE)
- XML parsers may process untrusted data and allow external entities to be included in XML documents, leading to security risks. Disable external entities and use safe XML parsers.

Broken Access Control
- Inadequate access control can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to restricted areas or data. Use proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.

Security Misconfiguration
- Misconfigured servers, software, or services can expose vulnerabilities. Ensure that your application and server configurations are secure and regularly updated.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Use proper input sanitization and output encoding to protect against XSS.

Insecure Deserialization
- Deserializing untrusted data can lead to remote code execution, object injection attacks, or other vulnerabilities. Avoid deserialization of untrusted data or use cryptographic signatures to ensure integrity.

Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Many applications rely on third-party libraries and components. Using outdated or insecure versions of these can expose your application to known vulnerabilities. Regularly update components and libraries and use dependency management tools.

Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
- Lack of adequate logging and monitoring can hinder the detection of security breaches. Implement detailed logging, monitor for suspicious activity, and set up alerts for potential threats.
